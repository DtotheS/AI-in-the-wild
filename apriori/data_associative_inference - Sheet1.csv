The operation was developed thanks to the strengthening of the units and port controls by the National Navy, which in this specific case allowed conducting investigations in coordination with the CTI of the Prosecutor's Office, establishing that the cargo ship was contaminated.

The inspection of the vessel, which was anchored in the Ciénaga - Magdalena sector, was carried out by units of the Santa Marta Coast Guard Station and CTI personnel, who found on board two packages with 40 packages containing the alkaloid , which were located in the chain store. Personnel from the Magdalena sectional CTI carried out the respective tests, giving positive for 39.8 kilograms of cocaine hydrochloride. There were no people captured.

The coal ship “Ping May” arrived in Colombia six days ago from England and was bound for the port of Rotterdam - Holland. This is the fifth foreign cargo ship that has been confirmed to have been contaminated with alkaloids in the port of Santa Marta.

So far this year, there are already more than 28 tons of cocaine seized by the National Navy in the Colombian Caribbean.

The National Navy will continue to carry out operations in order to guarantee the legal use of the sea and combat drug trafficking and its different modalities used for drug trafficking.

— U.S. Senate primary candidate Don Blankenship (R-W.Va.), in an ad attacking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)

“Having cocaine on a family-owned ship certainly should be of interest because cocaine deaths in this country keep going up, and even though that ship, I think, headed to Europe, we still need to be aware that there are cocaine and other drugs moving on the high seas on commercial ships. And if nothing else, it should make us aware that we need to be careful when these commercial ships are docking, when your country needs to see what’s on them. And certainly, the family of Elaine Chao and McConnell should be no exception to that.”

2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis
This fact check explores whether “Cocaine Mitch” is an accurate nickname for the Senate majority leader.


How did we end up here?

Blankenship, a Republican candidate in the Senate primary in West Virginia, released an ad claiming that “politicians … blew up the coal mine and then put me in prison.”

In fact, Blankenship spent a year in prison because a jury convicted him of conspiracy to violate federal safety standards. A 2010 explosion at a coal mine owned by Massey Energy, where Blankenship was chief executive, killed 29 workers at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia. A state investigation found that Massey Energy’s negligence was the main reason for “the faulty ventilation system, the inadequate application of rock dust and the equipment failures” that caused the blast.

Anyway, out of the blue, at the end of this ad, Blankenship calls McConnell “Cocaine Mitch.” He doesn’t explain it. There’s no tie-in to any of the other things Blankenship says in the ad. He just throws it out like a slab of red meat.


Blankenship’s campaign later issued a news release (“Don Blankenship Releases ‘Cocaine Mitch’ Ad Explanation”), which we read with interest.

Let’s dig in.

The Facts
Blankenship is competing in the May 8 primary for the Republican Senate nomination in West Virginia, where Sen. Joe Manchin III (D) is running for reelection in November.

The specific attack line about “Cocaine Mitch” has nothing to do with drug use. As our colleague Amber Phillips of The Fix pointed out, some Republican primary candidates choose to run as foils to the GOP establishment. In West Virginia, Blankenship has been firing off attacks at McConnell, his wife and his in-laws lately.

McConnell is married to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, whose family owns a New York shipping company named Foremost Group. The company was founded as Foremost Maritime Corp. by McConnell’s father-in-law, James S.C. Chao.


As of 2015, McConnell’s net worth was somewhere between $11 million and $43 million, according to Open Secrets. Lawmakers are required to disclose their assets and liabilities in broad ranges, not specific figures, which makes it tough to nail down exactly how wealthy they are.

As The Fact Checker previously reported, McConnell’s net worth appeared to surge in 2008, when he and his wife disclosed a tax-exempt money-market fund valued at between $5 million and $25 million. Elaine Chao inherited this money after her mother died in 2007, a McConnell spokesman told The Fact Checker.

In its news release, the Blankenship campaign pointed to an article in the Nation magazine from October 2014. Relying on an interview with a coast guard official in Colombia, the Nation reported that authorities in that country had found 40 packages of cocaine, or about 90 pounds, aboard the Ping May, a bulk carrier owned by Foremost Group. The ship was docked at the Colombian port city of Santa Marta and destined for the Netherlands with a shipment of coal, the magazine reported.


The Fact Checker found an August 2014 news release from the Colombian navy that corroborated much of the Nation’s reporting. According to the navy, the Ping May had arrived from the United Kingdom in mid-August 2014 and was departing for Rotterdam with its coal shipment later that month when Colombian authorities discovered the 40 packages of cocaine. “No persons were captured in the operation,” the Colombian navy said.

Two months later, when the Nation’s article was published, the Colombian investigation was described as ongoing, and no charges had been filed. The Nation did not follow up with more articles, and we couldn’t find any more information about this case in Colombian media.

“Mitch McConnell and his family have extensive ties to China,” the Blankenship campaign’s news release says. “His father-in-law who founded and owns a large Chinese shipping company has given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years. The company was implicated recently in smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Europe. Hidden aboard a company ship carrying foreign coal was $7 million dollars of cocaine and that is why we’ve deemed him ‘Cocaine Mitch.’”


Okay! Wow! There’s a lot to unpack here!

First, Foremost Group is not a “Chinese shipping company.” It’s an American company, based in New York.

Second, there is no evidence that McConnell’s father-in-law has “given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years.” Elaine Chao received an inheritance valued at between $5 million and $25 million after her mother’s death in 2007. This was years before the drug bust in Santa Marta in 2014. There is no record of McConnell receiving any other financial windfall from his in-laws.

Blankenship’s news release cites a book about McConnell and other politicians called “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,” by Peter Schweizer. In an interview with Breitbart News, Schweizer refers to this same $5 million to $25 million, and nothing else, as an example of the money McConnell has received from his father-in-law. “McConnell himself has benefited because a few years ago, James Chao gave Mitch McConnell a gift between five and twenty-five million dollars that more than quadrupled his net worth overnight,” Schweizer told Breitbart. Notice how he describes Elaine Chao’s inheritance as a “gift” from her father to McConnell.


Third, neither the Nation nor the Colombian navy reported that the cocaine was worth $7 million. The only way Blankenship’s campaign could have landed on that number is by making extra-generous assumptions.

In the United States, “the street price varies enormously because it depends on purity, which itself varies enormously,” Tom Wainwright, a journalist who wrote “Narconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel,” said in an email. “So people tend to quote figures for a pure gram (or kilo). The street price of a pure gram is roughly $150 (i.e., the equivalent of $150,000 per kilo), though again it will vary a lot.”

He added: “In practice, what you buy will probably be cheaper than that because it won’t be anything like 100 percent pure. You might pay $75 for a gram of ‘cocaine’ that is in fact 0.5g cocaine and 0.5g other random stuff.”


Assuming a street price of $150,000 per kilogram for the 40 packages of cocaine on the Ping May gets you to only $6 million, though, so it’s unclear how the Blankenship campaign arrived at $7 million. Perhaps it assumed that diluting the cocaine with cornstarch, caffeine or other additives would yield another $1 million. In any case, prices are lower in Europe, where these drugs were actually headed.

Most important, as of this writing, Colombian authorities do not appear to have filed charges in the Ping May drug bust. Charges would indicate that the Colombian government identified suspects, and who they were.

The Fact Checker reached out to the Colombian Embassy in Washington. We asked what the outcome of the Ping May investigation was and whether any charges were filed. A spokeswoman for the embassy referred us to a captain in the Colombian navy, who did not respond to our questions.


The absence of known charges is key.

The Ping May is a huge vessel with 91,385 tons of cargo capacity, which is about the same as 20 million cats, assuming each cat weighs the average 10 pounds.

For comparison, the 40 packages of cocaine, about 90 pounds total, would weigh the same as nine cats.


The Ping May (Colombian navy)
Joaquin Perez, a criminal defense lawyer in Miami who specializes in international drug-trafficking cases, said it would be difficult for Colombian authorities to charge anyone in these circumstances.

He said, “Forty kilos in a big ship with containers and stuff like that is not a significant amount, and in order to be able to ascribe responsibility to a person in such a large ship,” authorities would need to establish a clear nexus. Had the 40 kilos been found inside a shipping container, perhaps the company that owned the cargo inside might be held responsible. (The Ping May is a bulk carrier, though, so there were no containers.)

The Colombian navy said the drugs were found in the ship’s chain locker, a forward part of the ship that contains the anchor chain when the anchor is up.

“If it was found in the captain’s room, then you can charge the captain, or in one of the crew members’ rooms,” Perez said. “But short of that, I don’t know how you can charge anything.”

In short, just because Colombian officials found cocaine on the Ping May doesn’t mean Foremost Group was shipping it or planning to profit from its sale. Who hid the drugs in the ship’s chain locker? It’s anyone’s guess, but it’s important to remember that Colombian authorities do not appear to have charged the ship’s captain or crew. They didn’t charge Foremost Group or the Chaos. They certainly didn’t charge McConnell.

Spokespeople for McConnell and Foremost Group would not comment, and the Blankenship campaign did not respond to our questions.

The Pinocchio Test
This is a Four Pinocchio claim!

Set aside the four or five degrees of separation between McConnell and his wife’s family’s shipping company and the fact that Elaine Chao collected the inheritance at issue years before 2014. Without charges or further information from Colombia, we can’t determine who was trying to smuggle drugs on the Ping May.

We understand that “Cornstarch Mitch” is not as catchy as “Cocaine Mitch.” But the bottom line is that Blankenship has no evidence to support his crude and incendiary attack.",The Nation.,https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/mitch-mcconnells-freighted-ties-shadowy-shipping-company/,30 October 2014,Mitch McConnell’s Freighted Ties to a Shadowy Shipping Company.,"Before the Ping May, a rusty cargo vessel, could disembark from the port of Santa Marta en route to the Netherlands in late August, Colombian inspectors boarded the boat and made a discovery. Hidden in the ship’s chain locker, amidst its load of coal bound for Europe, were approximately 40 kilograms, or about ninety pounds, of cocaine. A Colombian Coast Guard official told The Nation that there is an ongoing investigation.

The seizure of the narcotics shipment in the Caribbean port occurred far away from Kentucky, the state in which Senator Mitch McConnell is now facing a career-defining election. But the Republican Senate minority leader has the closest of ties to the owner of the Ping May, the vessel containing the illicit materials: the Foremost Maritime Corporation, a firm founded and owned by McConnell’s in-laws, the Chao family.

Though Foremost has played a pivotal role in McConnell’s life, bestowing the senator with most of his personal wealth and generating thousands in donations to his campaign committees, the drug bust went unnoticed in Kentucky, where every bit of McConnell-related news has generated fodder for the campaign trail. That’s because, like many international shipping companies, Chao’s firm is shrouded from public view, concealing its identity and limiting its legal liability through an array of tax shelters and foreign registrations. Registered through a limited liability company in the Marshall Islands, the Ping May flies the Liberian flag.

How Much Could a Banana Republic Cost?

Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao with James Chao (image: ElaineLChao.com)

McConnell’s ties to the Chaos go back to the late 1980s, when James Chao began donating to the senator. In 1993, McConnell married James’s daughter, Elaine Chao, a Republican activist and former Reagan administration official who would later serve as secretary of labor in the George W. Bush cabinet. James Chao emigrated to the United States from Taiwan, and founded the Foremost Maritime Corporation upon settling in New York. The company has grown significantly over the years, from acting as maritime agent during the Vietnam War to controlling a fleet of approximately sixteen dry-bulk cargo ships in operation today.

Foremost acts as a shipping agent, purchasing vessels made primarily in China and coordinating shipment of commodities. Records reviewed by The Nation reveal that Foremost transports corn, chemicals and other goods to cities throughout the world. The company has offices in New York and Hong Kong.

Some of the goods shipped by Foremost echo themes of the McConnell campaign. At a Young Professionals Association of Louisville event this month, McConnell stressed his opposition to carbon dioxide limits imposed by the federal government that would impact the domestic coal market. He argued that such efforts would be fruitless given the role of coal in developing countries and the rising coal trade. Foremost ships routinely transport coal from ports in Australia and Colombia, countries with cheap coal, for export to Asia and Europe.

The firm, however, leaves a faint online trace. Foremost’s website FMCNY.com is blank. Records and court documents obtained by The Nation show that the ownership of the company’s vessels—with names such as Ping May, Soya May, Fu May and Grain May—is obscured through a byzantine structure of tax entities. Most of Foremost’s vessels are flagged in Liberia, which ensures that crew members of Foremost’s ships work under Liberia’s maritime labor laws, which critics note allow for intimidation in the workplace and few protections for labor unions. In addition, a Liberian “flag of convenience” allows ship owners to pay lower tonnage taxes than ships that fly the US flag. Maritime companies have increasingly used the Marshall Islands to register their vessels. The jurisdiction boasts of “no taxation, lax regulation, and no requirements for disclosure of many corporate details—even to the United States government,” according to a report in World Policy Journal.

The recent seizure of cocaine on a Foremost coal ship came as authorities in Colombia have stepped up anti-drug trafficking enforcement in the region. The Nation spoke to Luis Gonzales, an official with the Colombian Coast Guard in Santa Marta, who told us that the Ping May’s crew were questioned as part of an ongoing investigation, but that no charges have yet been filed. His team found the cocaine in forty separate packages.

Contacted by telephone, a representative of Foremost said he is “obviously going to have no comment on this one.”

McConnell has benefitted in many ways from his relationship with his in-laws.

The Republican Senate minority leader’s personal wealth grew seven-fold over the last ten years thanks in large part to a gift given to him and his wife in 2008 from James Chao worth between $5 million and $25 million (Senate ethics forms require personal finance disclosures in ranges of amounts, rather than specific figures). The gift helped the McConnells after their stock portfolio dipped in the wake of the financial crisis that year, and ensured they could pay off more than $100,000 in mortgage debt on their Washington home.

The generous gift made McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the Senate, with a net worth averaging around $22.8 million, according to The Washington Post’s review of his financial disclosures.

Following the gift, McConnell sent a letter of congratulations to an auditorium of Chinese officials in Shanghai who were gathered for an event honoring James Chao’s wife (McConnell’s mother-in-law, Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, who passed away in 2007). The Shanghai Mulan Education Foundation, created in her honor, regularly hosts students from the University of Louisville, where McConnell has a leadership academy bearing his name that sends students on trips to China.

The ties between McConnell and his in-laws have come under scrutiny before. In 2001, they were probed in depth by The New Republic in an article that charged that McConnell led an effort to soften his party’s criticism of China. Through James Chao, who was a classmate of Jiang Zemin, the president of China in the ’90s, McConnell and his wife met with Jiang several times, both in Beijing and in Washington. McConnell subsequently tempered his criticism of Chinese human rights abuses, and broke with hawks like Senator Jesse Helms to support Most Favored Nation trading status with China. As Foremost established closer ties with mainland China, McConnell endorsed the position that the United States should remain “ambiguous” about coming to the defense of Taiwan. In 1999, McConnell and his wife appeared at the University of Louisville with Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing. Li used the opportunity to bash congressional leaders for rebuking China over its repression of the Falun Gong religious sect. “Any responsible government will not foster evil propensities of cults by being over-lenient,” Li reportedly said at the event with McConnell and Chao. Rather than distance himself from the remarks, McConnell reportedly spoke about his “good working relationship” with Li.

Last Friday, McConnell dipped into his personal fortune to lend his own campaign $1.8 million for the final week before the election. Members of the Chao family and employees of Foremost have also given over $90,000 in contributions to McConnell over the years.

Requests for comment to the McConnell team about the Ping May cocaine incident have gone unanswered.

McConnell has positioned himself over the years as a tough on drugs politician. In 1996, McConnell was the sole sponsor of the Enhanced Marijuana Penalties Act, a bill to increase the mandatory minimum sentencing for those caught with certain amounts of marijuana. A press release noted that his bill would make “penalties for selling marijuana comparable to those for selling heroin and cocaine.”

In recent weeks, McConnell has touted his role in calling for more federal money to be used for drug enforcement.",AngelaChao.com,https://www.angelachao.org/family/,1 April 2019.,Family,"Angela’s parents are Americans of Chinese descent who came of age in China during the tumultuous first half of the 20th century.

Despite being a career politician for more than three decades, Mitch has become a millionaire while raising our national debt by 20 trillion dollars. The biggest jump in his wealth came from a multi-million dollar gift to his wife, Elaine Chao’s from her father, i.e. Foremost Maritime. The company uses ships chartered in Liberia, not America or China.
 

Ms. Chao’s father and sister actually joined the board in 2007 and 2008 of something called China State Shipbuilding Corporation, CSSC Holdings, which is a subsidiary of the largest defense contractor in China.
 

McConnell is so indebted to China that he even co-sponsor a Senate bill to remove human rights reporting requirements from free trade deals. Those requirements were put in place after China’s abuses following the protests for freedom we saw worldwide at Tiananmen Square. (S.2277)
 

A new book by Peter Schweizer examines how career politician Mitch McConnell used his elected influence and his wife’s family’s policies to get rich while regular Americans lost a trade war. A trade war that has cost millions their jobs and therefore created idleness and despair, which as we know leads to illegal drug use including cocaine. Cocaine overdose deaths in the United States are rising rapidly as a result.",Vox,https://www.vox.com/2018/5/7/17326708/cocaine-mitch-mcconnell-don-blankenship,7 May 2018,"Cocaine Mitch: Don Blankenship’s Factually Dubious Attack on McConnell, Explained.","One week ago, Don Blankenship — a Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia, facing a primary this Tuesday — released a new ad with a truly bizarre kicker. “One of my goals as US senator,” he said, “will be to ditch Cocaine Mitch.”

The idea of the mild-mannered, hopelessly square, seemingly vice-free Senate majority leader being some sort of cocaine baron comes off as ridiculous and even hilarious to many in the political world.

The thin-to-nonexistent basis for this charge is that McConnell’s in-laws, the Chao family, own a cargo shipping company, and a few years back, about 90 pounds of cocaine was found on one of that company’s ships as it was about to leave Colombia. However, no one has ever alleged that this apparent smuggling operation was run by the company itself, let alone that McConnell or his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, had any involvement.

The accusation of criminality is all the stranger since it’s coming from a candidate who himself was only recently released from prison. Blankenship is a former coal company CEO convicted of conspiring to violate federal mine safety laws after a disaster that killed 29 miners. Because of this, establishment Republicans, including McConnell and even President Trump, are desperate to defeat him in this week’s primary. (The winner will take on Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in the general election.)

But Blankenship is using a political strategy first honed by Trump to fight back. He’s crafted a brief, catchy, insulting, and vaguely absurd nickname for McConnell that is so outrageous and bizarre that he’s gotten the entire national media to talk about it. In doing so, he’s elevated McConnell — who is unpopular among Republican voters — as his foil. He’s also positioned himself as the most anti-establishment candidate in a three-way field.

And as the famous political saying goes, if you’re spending time explaining how the cocaine on your father-in-law’s ship isn’t a big deal, you’re losing.

The specifics of the “Cocaine Mitch” allegation (and why it’s so tenuous)
Al Pacino, as Tony Montana, contemplates cocaine in the film “Scarface”
Al Pacino, as Tony Montana, contemplates cocaine in Scarface. Scarface
Though Blankenship’s initial reference to “Cocaine Mitch” in an ad was unexplained, his campaign soon released a statement making clear what he was referring to — an article in the Nation from 2014, written by journalist Lee Fang.

Fang reported that in late August 2014, a cargo vessel owned by the Chao family company, Foremost Maritime Corporation, was supposed to sail from Santa Marta, Colombia, to the Netherlands. But before leaving Colombia, inspectors searched it. And they found 90 pounds of cocaine, in 40 separate packages.


This is, of course, not great. But there’s no evidence that the company was responsible for this (no charges ever seem to have been filed). Perhaps more likely is that this was an illicit operation on the part of some members of the ship’s crew. (The Washington Post’s Salvador Rizzo points out that the ship in question, the Ping May, is enormous, and even 90 pounds of cocaine would take up relatively little space on it.)

So how in the world does Blankenship tie this cocaine bust to the Senate majority leader?

Well, of course, there’s the obvious connection that Foremost Maritime Corporation was founded by James Chao, a Taiwanese-American shipping magnate and father of McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao. Foremost is still controlled by the Chao family, and its current CEO is Elaine’s sister, Angela Chao.

It also appears that a large chunk of McConnell and Elaine Chao’s wealth comes from the Foremost fortune. Disclosure forms reveal that in 2008, the couple’s wealth soared enormously as a result of a multimillion-dollar gift from James Chao after the death of his wife (Elaine’s mother). The gift was worth between $5 million and $25 million.

But of course, there’s nothing tying McConnell or Chao to any knowledge of or involvement in cocaine smuggling. Why, did you think there would be? What would have led you to believe that?

Blankenship is using “Cocaine Mitch” to make racist attacks on McConnell’s family — and to position himself as the anti-establishment candidate

It’s probably a mistake to ascribe too much strategic mastery to Blankenship, who has the charisma of a damp dishrag and whose ads seem downright amateurish.

But with “Cocaine Mitch” specifically and his attacks on McConnell generally, he may have stumbled into an effective strategy, of launching both corruption-focused and racist attacks at the unpopular majority leader and his family.


“Swamp Captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for Chinapeople,” Blankenship says in his second “Cocaine Mitch” ad (embedded above). “While doing so, Mitch has gotten rich. In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars.” He continues: “The war to drain the swamp and create jobs for West Virginia people has begun. I will beat Joe Manchin and ditch Cocaine Mitch for the sake of the kids.”

Indeed, even before all this, Blankenship told Politico that McConnell “has a lot of connections in China” and that because Elaine Chao is “from China ... we have to be really concerned that we are in truth” protecting American interests. (Oddly enough, according to Politico, Blankenship’s current girlfriend was also born in China. Whatever!)

From all this, you can see how the “Cocaine Mitch” attack could actually work. Voters hear this silly thing and naturally ask, why is Blankenship talking about Cocaine Mitch? And the answer is, “Well, McConnell’s in-laws are the Chao family, and they own a ship on which cocaine was found, but no charges were filed!” and suddenly voters with racist leanings are thinking about McConnell’s Asian relatives and drugs and corruption.

Will this be Donald Trump and Roy Moore all over again?
Roy Moore

If all of this sounds familiar to you, well, you’re not alone.

McConnell and his allies tried their hardest to stop Roy Moore, a deeply controversial former judge with a history of extremist comments, from winning the Alabama Republican Senate primary last year. But Moore simply ran on the fact that the unpopular McConnell hated him — a message that powered him to victory in the primary despite President Trump’s support of his opponent. (The accusations that Moore preyed on underage girls came out after the primary, and he narrowly lost the election to Democratic nominee Doug Jones.)

Now, again, President Trump is urging West Virginia voters not to support Blankenship because he’s unelectable:

To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2018
But of course, similar arguments were made against Trump during his primary campaign and fell on deaf ears — Republican voters have a remarkably low level of trust in their party’s establishment these days.

And there may be further similarities to the 2016 presidential primary here. Yes, Blankenship has come up with a strange nickname just like Trump did. But beyond that, he’s saying outrageous, ridiculous, and racist things, and that’s helping him get attention in a divided field. (It’s a three-way race and his opponents, state Attorney General Pat Morrisey and Rep. Evan Jenkins, are more obviously establishment figures.)

Media coverage in the last week of the race focused a great deal on Blankenship’s controversies, and in a race where he only needs plurality support to win, that could be helping him draw in voters. Though the outcome is still of course uncertain, the Weekly Standard’s John McCormack reports that two internal polls taken in the past few days both show Blankenship with a narrow lead.

But surely a corrupt, racist outsider businessman with a penchant for disparaging nicknames who’s named Don couldn’t win a high-profile Republican primary ... right?",https://www.foremostgroupusa.com/about/,ForemostGroupUsa.com,Accessed 1 April 2019,About,"“Our mission is to remain a premier provider of ocean transportation services and a model of excellence for our industry.”
