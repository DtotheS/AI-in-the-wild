The operation was developed thanks to the strengthening of the units and port controls by the National Navy, which in this specific case allowed conducting investigations in coordination with the CTI of the Prosecutor's Office, establishing that the cargo ship was contaminated.

The inspection of the vessel, which was anchored in the Ciénaga - Magdalena sector, was carried out by units of the Santa Marta Coast Guard Station and CTI personnel, who found on board two packages with 40 packages containing the alkaloid , which were located in the chain store. Personnel from the Magdalena sectional CTI carried out the respective tests, giving positive for 39.8 kilograms of cocaine hydrochloride. There were no people captured.

The coal ship “Ping May” arrived in Colombia six days ago from England and was bound for the port of Rotterdam - Holland. This is the fifth foreign cargo ship that has been confirmed to have been contaminated with alkaloids in the port of Santa Marta.

So far this year, there are already more than 28 tons of cocaine seized by the National Navy in the Colombian Caribbean.

The National Navy will continue to carry out operations in order to guarantee the legal use of the sea and combat drug trafficking and its different modalities used for drug trafficking.

— U.S. Senate primary candidate Don Blankenship (R-W.Va.), in an ad attacking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)

“Having cocaine on a family-owned ship certainly should be of interest because cocaine deaths in this country keep going up, and even though that ship, I think, headed to Europe, we still need to be aware that there are cocaine and other drugs moving on the high seas on commercial ships. And if nothing else, it should make us aware that we need to be careful when these commercial ships are docking, when your country needs to see what’s on them. And certainly, the family of Elaine Chao and McConnell should be no exception to that.”

2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis
This fact check explores whether “Cocaine Mitch” is an accurate nickname for the Senate majority leader.


How did we end up here?

Blankenship, a Republican candidate in the Senate primary in West Virginia, released an ad claiming that “politicians … blew up the coal mine and then put me in prison.”

In fact, Blankenship spent a year in prison because a jury convicted him of conspiracy to violate federal safety standards. A 2010 explosion at a coal mine owned by Massey Energy, where Blankenship was chief executive, killed 29 workers at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia. A state investigation found that Massey Energy’s negligence was the main reason for “the faulty ventilation system, the inadequate application of rock dust and the equipment failures” that caused the blast.

Anyway, out of the blue, at the end of this ad, Blankenship calls McConnell “Cocaine Mitch.” He doesn’t explain it. There’s no tie-in to any of the other things Blankenship says in the ad. He just throws it out like a slab of red meat.


Blankenship’s campaign later issued a news release (“Don Blankenship Releases ‘Cocaine Mitch’ Ad Explanation”), which we read with interest.

Let’s dig in.

The Facts
Blankenship is competing in the May 8 primary for the Republican Senate nomination in West Virginia, where Sen. Joe Manchin III (D) is running for reelection in November.

The specific attack line about “Cocaine Mitch” has nothing to do with drug use. As our colleague Amber Phillips of The Fix pointed out, some Republican primary candidates choose to run as foils to the GOP establishment. In West Virginia, Blankenship has been firing off attacks at McConnell, his wife and his in-laws lately.

McConnell is married to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, whose family owns a New York shipping company named Foremost Group. The company was founded as Foremost Maritime Corp. by McConnell’s father-in-law, James S.C. Chao.


As of 2015, McConnell’s net worth was somewhere between $11 million and $43 million, according to Open Secrets. Lawmakers are required to disclose their assets and liabilities in broad ranges, not specific figures, which makes it tough to nail down exactly how wealthy they are.

As The Fact Checker previously reported, McConnell’s net worth appeared to surge in 2008, when he and his wife disclosed a tax-exempt money-market fund valued at between $5 million and $25 million. Elaine Chao inherited this money after her mother died in 2007, a McConnell spokesman told The Fact Checker.

In its news release, the Blankenship campaign pointed to an article in the Nation magazine from October 2014. Relying on an interview with a coast guard official in Colombia, the Nation reported that authorities in that country had found 40 packages of cocaine, or about 90 pounds, aboard the Ping May, a bulk carrier owned by Foremost Group. The ship was docked at the Colombian port city of Santa Marta and destined for the Netherlands with a shipment of coal, the magazine reported.


The Fact Checker found an August 2014 news release from the Colombian navy that corroborated much of the Nation’s reporting. According to the navy, the Ping May had arrived from the United Kingdom in mid-August 2014 and was departing for Rotterdam with its coal shipment later that month when Colombian authorities discovered the 40 packages of cocaine. “No persons were captured in the operation,” the Colombian navy said.

Two months later, when the Nation’s article was published, the Colombian investigation was described as ongoing, and no charges had been filed. The Nation did not follow up with more articles, and we couldn’t find any more information about this case in Colombian media.

“Mitch McConnell and his family have extensive ties to China,” the Blankenship campaign’s news release says. “His father-in-law who founded and owns a large Chinese shipping company has given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years. The company was implicated recently in smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Europe. Hidden aboard a company ship carrying foreign coal was $7 million dollars of cocaine and that is why we’ve deemed him ‘Cocaine Mitch.’”


Okay! Wow! There’s a lot to unpack here!

First, Foremost Group is not a “Chinese shipping company.” It’s an American company, based in New York.

Second, there is no evidence that McConnell’s father-in-law has “given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years.” Elaine Chao received an inheritance valued at between $5 million and $25 million after her mother’s death in 2007. This was years before the drug bust in Santa Marta in 2014. There is no record of McConnell receiving any other financial windfall from his in-laws.

Blankenship’s news release cites a book about McConnell and other politicians called “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,” by Peter Schweizer. In an interview with Breitbart News, Schweizer refers to this same $5 million to $25 million, and nothing else, as an example of the money McConnell has received from his father-in-law. “McConnell himself has benefited because a few years ago, James Chao gave Mitch McConnell a gift between five and twenty-five million dollars that more than quadrupled his net worth overnight,” Schweizer told Breitbart. Notice how he describes Elaine Chao’s inheritance as a “gift” from her father to McConnell.


Third, neither the Nation nor the Colombian navy reported that the cocaine was worth $7 million. The only way Blankenship’s campaign could have landed on that number is by making extra-generous assumptions.

In the United States, “the street price varies enormously because it depends on purity, which itself varies enormously,” Tom Wainwright, a journalist who wrote “Narconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel,” said in an email. “So people tend to quote figures for a pure gram (or kilo). The street price of a pure gram is roughly $150 (i.e., the equivalent of $150,000 per kilo), though again it will vary a lot.”

He added: “In practice, what you buy will probably be cheaper than that because it won’t be anything like 100 percent pure. You might pay $75 for a gram of ‘cocaine’ that is in fact 0.5g cocaine and 0.5g other random stuff.”


Assuming a street price of $150,000 per kilogram for the 40 packages of cocaine on the Ping May gets you to only $6 million, though, so it’s unclear how the Blankenship campaign arrived at $7 million. Perhaps it assumed that diluting the cocaine with cornstarch, caffeine or other additives would yield another $1 million. In any case, prices are lower in Europe, where these drugs were actually headed.

Most important, as of this writing, Colombian authorities do not appear to have filed charges in the Ping May drug bust. Charges would indicate that the Colombian government identified suspects, and who they were.

The Fact Checker reached out to the Colombian Embassy in Washington. We asked what the outcome of the Ping May investigation was and whether any charges were filed. A spokeswoman for the embassy referred us to a captain in the Colombian navy, who did not respond to our questions.


The absence of known charges is key.

The Ping May is a huge vessel with 91,385 tons of cargo capacity, which is about the same as 20 million cats, assuming each cat weighs the average 10 pounds.

For comparison, the 40 packages of cocaine, about 90 pounds total, would weigh the same as nine cats.


The Ping May (Colombian navy)
Joaquin Perez, a criminal defense lawyer in Miami who specializes in international drug-trafficking cases, said it would be difficult for Colombian authorities to charge anyone in these circumstances.

He said, “Forty kilos in a big ship with containers and stuff like that is not a significant amount, and in order to be able to ascribe responsibility to a person in such a large ship,” authorities would need to establish a clear nexus. Had the 40 kilos been found inside a shipping container, perhaps the company that owned the cargo inside might be held responsible. (The Ping May is a bulk carrier, though, so there were no containers.)

The Colombian navy said the drugs were found in the ship’s chain locker, a forward part of the ship that contains the anchor chain when the anchor is up.

“If it was found in the captain’s room, then you can charge the captain, or in one of the crew members’ rooms,” Perez said. “But short of that, I don’t know how you can charge anything.”

In short, just because Colombian officials found cocaine on the Ping May doesn’t mean Foremost Group was shipping it or planning to profit from its sale. Who hid the drugs in the ship’s chain locker? It’s anyone’s guess, but it’s important to remember that Colombian authorities do not appear to have charged the ship’s captain or crew. They didn’t charge Foremost Group or the Chaos. They certainly didn’t charge McConnell.

Spokespeople for McConnell and Foremost Group would not comment, and the Blankenship campaign did not respond to our questions.

The Pinocchio Test
This is a Four Pinocchio claim!

Set aside the four or five degrees of separation between McConnell and his wife’s family’s shipping company and the fact that Elaine Chao collected the inheritance at issue years before 2014. Without charges or further information from Colombia, we can’t determine who was trying to smuggle drugs on the Ping May.

We understand that “Cornstarch Mitch” is not as catchy as “Cocaine Mitch.” But the bottom line is that Blankenship has no evidence to support his crude and incendiary attack."""
1,4,source-news,FALSE,The Nation,https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/mitch-mcconnells-freighted-ties-shadowy-shipping-company/,Mitch McConnell’s Freighted Ties to a Shadowy Shipping Company.,10/30/14,"""Before the Ping May, a rusty cargo vessel, could disembark from the port of Santa Marta en route to the Netherlands in late August, Colombian inspectors boarded the boat and made a discovery. Hidden in the ship’s chain locker, amidst its load of coal bound for Europe, were approximately 40 kilograms, or about ninety pounds, of cocaine. A Colombian Coast Guard official told The Nation that there is an ongoing investigation.

The seizure of the narcotics shipment in the Caribbean port occurred far away from Kentucky, the state in which Senator Mitch McConnell is now facing a career-defining election. But the Republican Senate minority leader has the closest of ties to the owner of the Ping May, the vessel containing the illicit materials: the Foremost Maritime Corporation, a firm founded and owned by McConnell’s in-laws, the Chao family.

Though Foremost has played a pivotal role in McConnell’s life, bestowing the senator with most of his personal wealth and generating thousands in donations to his campaign committees, the drug bust went unnoticed in Kentucky, where every bit of McConnell-related news has generated fodder for the campaign trail. That’s because, like many international shipping companies, Chao’s firm is shrouded from public view, concealing its identity and limiting its legal liability through an array of tax shelters and foreign registrations. Registered through a limited liability company in the Marshall Islands, the Ping May flies the Liberian flag.

How Much Could a Banana Republic Cost?

McConnell’s ties to the Chaos go back to the late 1980s, when James Chao began donating to the senator. In 1993, McConnell married James’s daughter, Elaine Chao, a Republican activist and former Reagan administration official who would later serve as secretary of labor in the George W. Bush cabinet. James Chao emigrated to the United States from Taiwan, and founded the Foremost Maritime Corporation upon settling in New York. The company has grown significantly over the years, from acting as maritime agent during the Vietnam War to controlling a fleet of approximately sixteen dry-bulk cargo ships in operation today.

Foremost acts as a shipping agent, purchasing vessels made primarily in China and coordinating shipment of commodities. Records reviewed by The Nation reveal that Foremost transports corn, chemicals and other goods to cities throughout the world. The company has offices in New York and Hong Kong.

Some of the goods shipped by Foremost echo themes of the McConnell campaign. At a Young Professionals Association of Louisville event this month, McConnell stressed his opposition to carbon dioxide limits imposed by the federal government that would impact the domestic coal market. He argued that such efforts would be fruitless given the role of coal in developing countries and the rising coal trade. Foremost ships routinely transport coal from ports in Australia and Colombia, countries with cheap coal, for export to Asia and Europe.

The firm, however, leaves a faint online trace. Foremost’s website FMCNY.com is blank. Records and court documents obtained by The Nation show that the ownership of the company’s vessels—with names such as Ping May, Soya May, Fu May and Grain May—is obscured through a byzantine structure of tax entities. Most of Foremost’s vessels are flagged in Liberia, which ensures that crew members of Foremost’s ships work under Liberia’s maritime labor laws, which critics note allow for intimidation in the workplace and few protections for labor unions. In addition, a Liberian “flag of convenience” allows ship owners to pay lower tonnage taxes than ships that fly the US flag. Maritime companies have increasingly used the Marshall Islands to register their vessels. The jurisdiction boasts of “no taxation, lax regulation, and no requirements for disclosure of many corporate details—even to the United States government,” according to a report in World Policy Journal.

The recent seizure of cocaine on a Foremost coal ship came as authorities in Colombia have stepped up anti-drug trafficking enforcement in the region. The Nation spoke to Luis Gonzales, an official with the Colombian Coast Guard in Santa Marta, who told us that the Ping May’s crew were questioned as part of an ongoing investigation, but that no charges have yet been filed. His team found the cocaine in forty separate packages.

Contacted by telephone, a representative of Foremost said he is “obviously going to have no comment on this one.”

McConnell has benefitted in many ways from his relationship with his in-laws.

The Republican Senate minority leader’s personal wealth grew seven-fold over the last ten years thanks in large part to a gift given to him and his wife in 2008 from James Chao worth between $5 million and $25 million (Senate ethics forms require personal finance disclosures in ranges of amounts, rather than specific figures). The gift helped the McConnells after their stock portfolio dipped in the wake of the financial crisis that year, and ensured they could pay off more than $100,000 in mortgage debt on their Washington home.

The generous gift made McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the Senate, with a net worth averaging around $22.8 million, according to The Washington Post’s review of his financial disclosures.

Following the gift, McConnell sent a letter of congratulations to an auditorium of Chinese officials in Shanghai who were gathered for an event honoring James Chao’s wife (McConnell’s mother-in-law, Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, who passed away in 2007). The Shanghai Mulan Education Foundation, created in her honor, regularly hosts students from the University of Louisville, where McConnell has a leadership academy bearing his name that sends students on trips to China.

The ties between McConnell and his in-laws have come under scrutiny before. In 2001, they were probed in depth by The New Republic in an article that charged that McConnell led an effort to soften his party’s criticism of China. Through James Chao, who was a classmate of Jiang Zemin, the president of China in the ’90s, McConnell and his wife met with Jiang several times, both in Beijing and in Washington. McConnell subsequently tempered his criticism of Chinese human rights abuses, and broke with hawks like Senator Jesse Helms to support Most Favored Nation trading status with China. As Foremost established closer ties with mainland China, McConnell endorsed the position that the United States should remain “ambiguous” about coming to the defense of Taiwan. In 1999, McConnell and his wife appeared at the University of Louisville with Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing. Li used the opportunity to bash congressional leaders for rebuking China over its repression of the Falun Gong religious sect. “Any responsible government will not foster evil propensities of cults by being over-lenient,” Li reportedly said at the event with McConnell and Chao. Rather than distance himself from the remarks, McConnell reportedly spoke about his “good working relationship” with Li.

Last Friday, McConnell dipped into his personal fortune to lend his own campaign $1.8 million for the final week before the election. Members of the Chao family and employees of Foremost have also given over $90,000 in contributions to McConnell over the years.

Requests for comment to the McConnell team about the Ping May cocaine incident have gone unanswered.

McConnell has positioned himself over the years as a tough on drugs politician. In 1996, McConnell was the sole sponsor of the Enhanced Marijuana Penalties Act, a bill to increase the mandatory minimum sentencing for those caught with certain amounts of marijuana. A press release noted that his bill would make “penalties for selling marijuana comparable to those for selling heroin and cocaine.”

In recent weeks, McConnell has touted his role in calling for more federal money to be used for drug enforcement."""

Despite being a career politician for more than three decades, Mitch has become a millionaire while raising our national debt by 20 trillion dollars. The biggest jump in his wealth came from a multi-million dollar gift to his wife, Elaine Chao’s from her father, i.e. Foremost Maritime. The company uses ships chartered in Liberia, not America or China.
 

Ms. Chao’s father and sister actually joined the board in 2007 and 2008 of something called China State Shipbuilding Corporation, CSSC Holdings, which is a subsidiary of the largest defense contractor in China.
 

McConnell is so indebted to China that he even co-sponsor a Senate bill to remove human rights reporting requirements from free trade deals. Those requirements were put in place after China’s abuses following the protests for freedom we saw worldwide at Tiananmen Square. (S.2277)
 

A new book by Peter Schweizer examines how career politician Mitch McConnell used his elected influence and his wife’s family’s policies to get rich while regular Americans lost a trade war. A trade war that has cost millions their jobs and therefore created idleness and despair, which as we know leads to illegal drug use including cocaine.

The idea of the mild-mannered, hopelessly square, seemingly vice-free Senate majority leader being some sort of cocaine baron comes off as ridiculous and even hilarious to many in the political world.

The thin-to-nonexistent basis for this charge is that McConnell’s in-laws, the Chao family, own a cargo shipping company, and a few years back, about 90 pounds of cocaine was found on one of that company’s ships as it was about to leave Colombia. However, no one has ever alleged that this apparent smuggling operation was run by the company itself, let alone that McConnell or his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, had any involvement.

The accusation of criminality is all the stranger since it’s coming from a candidate who himself was only recently released from prison. Blankenship is a former coal company CEO convicted of conspiring to violate federal mine safety laws after a disaster that killed 29 miners. Because of this, establishment Republicans, including McConnell and even President Trump, are desperate to defeat him in this week’s primary. (The winner will take on Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in the general election.)

But Blankenship is using a political strategy first honed by Trump to fight back. He’s crafted a brief, catchy, insulting, and vaguely absurd nickname for McConnell that is so outrageous and bizarre that he’s gotten the entire national media to talk about it. In doing so, he’s elevated McConnell — who is unpopular among Republican voters — as his foil. He’s also positioned himself as the most anti-establishment candidate in a three-way field.

And as the famous political saying goes, if you’re spending time explaining how the cocaine on your father-in-law’s ship isn’t a big deal, you’re losing.

The specifics of the “Cocaine Mitch” allegation (and why it’s so tenuous)
Al Pacino, as Tony Montana, contemplates cocaine in the film “Scarface”
Al Pacino, as Tony Montana, contemplates cocaine in Scarface. Scarface
Though Blankenship’s initial reference to “Cocaine Mitch” in an ad was unexplained, his campaign soon released a statement making clear what he was referring to — an article in the Nation from 2014, written by journalist Lee Fang.

Fang reported that in late August 2014, a cargo vessel owned by the Chao family company, Foremost Maritime Corporation, was supposed to sail from Santa Marta, Colombia, to the Netherlands. But before leaving Colombia, inspectors searched it. And they found 90 pounds of cocaine, in 40 separate packages.


This is, of course, not great. But there’s no evidence that the company was responsible for this (no charges ever seem to have been filed). Perhaps more likely is that this was an illicit operation on the part of some members of the ship’s crew. (The Washington Post’s Salvador Rizzo points out that the ship in question, the Ping May, is enormous, and even 90 pounds of cocaine would take up relatively little space on it.)

So how in the world does Blankenship tie this cocaine bust to the Senate majority leader?

Well, of course, there’s the obvious connection that Foremost Maritime Corporation was founded by James Chao, a Taiwanese-American shipping magnate and father of McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao. Foremost is still controlled by the Chao family, and its current CEO is Elaine’s sister, Angela Chao.

It also appears that a large chunk of McConnell and Elaine Chao’s wealth comes from the Foremost fortune. Disclosure forms reveal that in 2008, the couple’s wealth soared enormously as a result of a multimillion-dollar gift from James Chao after the death of his wife (Elaine’s mother). The gift was worth between $5 million and $25 million.

But of course, there’s nothing tying McConnell or Chao to any knowledge of or involvement in cocaine smuggling. Why, did you think there would be? What would have led you to believe that?

Blankenship is using “Cocaine Mitch” to make racist attacks on McConnell’s family — and to position himself as the anti-establishment candidate

It’s probably a mistake to ascribe too much strategic mastery to Blankenship, who has the charisma of a damp dishrag and whose ads seem downright amateurish.

But with “Cocaine Mitch” specifically and his attacks on McConnell generally, he may have stumbled into an effective strategy, of launching both corruption-focused and racist attacks at the unpopular majority leader and his family.


“Swamp Captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for Chinapeople,” Blankenship says in his second “Cocaine Mitch” ad (embedded above). “While doing so, Mitch has gotten rich. In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars.” He continues: “The war to drain the swamp and create jobs for West Virginia people has begun. I will beat Joe Manchin and ditch Cocaine Mitch for the sake of the kids.”

Indeed, even before all this, Blankenship told Politico that McConnell “has a lot of connections in China” and that because Elaine Chao is “from China ... we have to be really concerned that we are in truth” protecting American interests. (Oddly enough, according to Politico, Blankenship’s current girlfriend was also born in China. Whatever!)

From all this, you can see how the “Cocaine Mitch” attack could actually work. Voters hear this silly thing and naturally ask, why is Blankenship talking about Cocaine Mitch? And the answer is, “Well, McConnell’s in-laws are the Chao family, and they own a ship on which cocaine was found, but no charges were filed!” and suddenly voters with racist leanings are thinking about McConnell’s Asian relatives and drugs and corruption.

Will this be Donald Trump and Roy Moore all over again?
Roy Moore

If all of this sounds familiar to you, well, you’re not alone.

McConnell and his allies tried their hardest to stop Roy Moore, a deeply controversial former judge with a history of extremist comments, from winning the Alabama Republican Senate primary last year. But Moore simply ran on the fact that the unpopular McConnell hated him — a message that powered him to victory in the primary despite President Trump’s support of his opponent. (The accusations that Moore preyed on underage girls came out after the primary, and he narrowly lost the election to Democratic nominee Doug Jones.)

Now, again, President Trump is urging West Virginia voters not to support Blankenship because he’s unelectable:

To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2018
But of course, similar arguments were made against Trump during his primary campaign and fell on deaf ears — Republican voters have a remarkably low level of trust in their party’s establishment these days.

And there may be further similarities to the 2016 presidential primary here. Yes, Blankenship has come up with a strange nickname just like Trump did. But beyond that, he’s saying outrageous, ridiculous, and racist things, and that’s helping him get attention in a divided field. (It’s a three-way race and his opponents, state Attorney General Pat Morrisey and Rep. Evan Jenkins, are more obviously establishment figures.)

Media coverage in the last week of the race focused a great deal on Blankenship’s controversies, and in a race where he only needs plurality support to win, that could be helping him draw in voters. Though the outcome is still of course uncertain, the Weekly Standard’s John McCormack reports that two internal polls taken in the past few days both show Blankenship with a narrow lead.

But surely a corrupt, racist outsider businessman with a penchant for disparaging nicknames who’s named Don couldn’t win a high-profile Republican primary ... right?"""

The Trump administration rolled back a few guidelines of an Obama-era school lunch initiative, but the program wasn't cancelled, and those changes were made in May 2017.",10/25/18,President Trump cancelled Michelle Obama's school lunch program in October 2018.
2,2,source-news,TRUE,Tampa Bay Times,https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/trump-administration-relaxes-michelle-obamas-healthy-standards-for-school/2322291/, “Trump Administration Relaxes Michelle Obama’s Nutrition Standards for School Meals.”,5/1/17,"LEESBURG, Va. — Schools won't have to cut more salt from meals just yet and some will be able to serve kids fewer whole grains, under changes to federal nutrition standards announced Monday.

The move by the Trump administration partially rolls back rules championed by former first lady Michelle Obama as part of her healthy eating initiative.

As his first major action in office, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the department will delay an upcoming requirement to lower the amount of sodium in meals while continuing to allow waivers for regulations that all grains on the lunch line must be 50 percent whole grain.


Schools could also serve 1 percent flavored milk instead of the nonfat now required.

""If kids aren't eating the food, and it's ending up in the trash, they aren't getting any nutrition — thus undermining the intent of the program,"" said Perdue, who traveled to a school in Leesburg, Va., to make the announcement.

Before he signed the proclamation, Perdue and Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., ate chicken nuggets, fruit and salad with children at Catoctin Elementary. Perdue said he doesn't see the changes as a rollback, but ""we're just slowing down the process."" He praised Obama's nutrition efforts as first lady but said he wants the healthier meals to be more palatable.

He said the department will work on long-term solutions to further tweak the rules.

The changes reflect suggestions from the School Nutrition Association, which represents school nutrition directors and companies that sell food to schools. The group often battled with the Obama administration, which phased in the healthier school meal rules starting in 2012.

The Obama administration rules set fat, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. Schools have long been required to follow government nutrition rules if they accept federal reimbursements for free and reduced-price meals for low-income students, but these standards were stricter. Obama pushed the changes as part of her ""Let's Move"" campaign to combat childhood obesity.


The Trump administration changes leave most of the Obama administration rules in place, including rules that students must take fruits and vegetables on the lunch line. Some schools have asked for changes to that policy, saying students often throw them away.

But health advocates who have championed the rules are concerned about the freeze in sodium levels, in particular. School lunches for elementary school students are now required to have less than 1,230 mg of sodium, a change put in place in 2014. The changes would keep the meals at that level, delaying until at least 2020 a requirement to lower sodium to 935 mg. That requirement was scheduled to begin in the 2017-2018 school year.

""By forgoing the next phase of sodium reduction, the Trump administration will be locking in dangerously high sodium levels in school lunch,"" said Margo Wootan, a lobbyist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

Becky Domokos-Bays, the nutrition director for Loudon County, Va., including Catoctin Elementary, said she has been experimenting with the lower sodium levels and she's had a hard time adjusting some of the more popular foods she serves. Kids like her chicken noodle soup, she says, but rejected it when she lowered the sodium content because it was thinner and had less taste.

As the healthier school meals have now been in place for five years, many schools and schoolchildren have gotten used to them. But nutrition directors like Domokos-Bays have said some parts of the law are still causing them trouble, such as finding tasty foods that are high in whole grains. In addition to the grits, nutrition directors have said they have a hard time finding whole grain pastas, biscuits and tortillas that kids will eat.


Perdue, a former governor of Georgia, said some schools in the South have had problems with grits, because ""the whole grain variety has little black flakes in it"" and kids won't eat it.

""The school is compliant with the whole-grain requirements, but no one is eating the grits,"" Perdue said. ""That doesn't make any sense.""

Others don't want to see any changes to the healthier meals. Outside the school, Leesburg mayor Kelly Burk and about 20 others protested ahead of the announcement. One sign read: ""Sonny — Our children do not want big business soda, chips and fries!""

""Some people don't like regulations, but these are important regulations that impact kids,"" Burk said."

It's just too hard for schools to do and kids don't like the food, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.

""If kids aren't eating the food, and it's ending up in the trash, they aren't getting any nutrition — thus undermining the intent of the program,"" Perdue said in a statement. The Agriculture Department has jurisdiction over school food programs.

""Schools are experiencing challenges in finding the full range of products they need and that their students enjoy in whole grain-rich form. They need continued flexibility in meeting the whole grain requirements for school meals,"" USDA said in a statement headlined ""Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again.""

The rules were part of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act signed by President Barack Obama and promoted by first lady Michelle Obama as part of her ""Let's Move"" initiative.

""I've got 14 grandchildren, and there is no way that I would propose something if I didn't think it was good, healthful, and the right thing to do.""

""It’s discouraging that just days into his tenure, one of the first things that Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue will do is to roll back progress on the quality of the meals served to America’s children,"" margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement.

""Ninety percent of American kids eat too much sodium every day. Schools have been moving in the right direction, so it makes no sense to freeze that progress in its tracks—and allow dangerously high levels of salt in school lunch.""

Perdue said USDA would work on more permanent solutions but in the meantime would let school districts opt out of some of the requirements.

""A perfect example is in the south, where the schools want to serve grits,"" said Perdue, a former governor of Georgia.

""But the whole grain variety has little black flakes in it, and the kids won't eat it. The school is compliant with the whole grain requirements, but no one is eating the grits. That doesn't make any sense.""

USDA also is giving schools a break on meeting low-sodium requirements through 2020, as well as looser requirement on the types of milk they can serve.

""Perdue will direct USDA to begin the regulatory process for schools to serve 1 percent flavored milk through the school meals programs,"" the agency said.

The new approach is included in the budget agreement sent to Congress for a vote this week, which would fund the government through October.

""The Secretary of Agriculture shall allow States to grant an exemption from the whole grain requirements that took effect on or after July 1, 2014, and the States shall establish a process for evaluating and responding, in a reasonable amount of time, to requests for an exemption,"" the budget agreement reads.

Separately, the Food and Drug Administration delayed restaurant menu labeling requirements by a full year, to 2018. The restaurant industry had lobbied hard against the rule and succeeded in delaying it multiple times.

""The FDA has made the right decision to delay a rule that would have essentially dictated how every food service establishment in America with more than 20 locations — restaurants, grocery stores, movie theaters, and more — writes and displays their menus,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said in a statement.

CSPI didn't like that decision, either.

""Republicans are just as likely as Democrats to suffer from diabetes, heart disease, and other diet-related health problems,"" Wootan said. ""Yet the Trump Administration is myopically putting Big Food’s interests over the interests of American consumers."""

Gordon Ernst was one of the coaches alleged to have accepted bribes from parents to provide entry into elite universities under the guise of recruiting. He also coached Michelle Obama.",3/18/19,The Obama family was caught up in the March 2019 college admissions scandal.
3,2,source-news,,New York Post. ,https://nypost.com/2019/03/12/lori-loughlin-felicity-huffman-busted-in-college-admissions-cheating-scandal/,"“Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin Busted in College Admissions Cheating Scandal.”",3/12/19,"TV actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are among dozens of people charged with paying bribes to get their kids into top universities in a widespread college admissions scam, prosecutors announced on Tuesday.

More than 40 people have been indicted in the scheme that allegedly involved students gaining entrance to schools including Georgetown, Stanford, Wake Forest University, UCLA and Yale as recruited athletes — regardless of their athletic ability — or on inflated college entrance exam test scores.

Some deep-pocketed parents paid as much as $6.5 million — while most plunked down between $250,000 and $400,000.

“There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy and there will not be a separate criminal justice system either,” said Massachusetts US Attorney Andrew Lelling at a press conference. “We’re not talking about donating a building so a school is more likely to take your son or daughter, we’re talking about deception or fraud, fake test scores … bribed college officials.”

Federal prosecutors in Boston say parents paid an admissions consultant, William Rick Singer, $25 million from 2011 through February 2019 to bribe the coaches and administrators in order to help their kids get accepted.

The California college-prep expert is also accused of steering some of that money to SAT and ACT administrators, who would then either take the test for the student or change their answers to the correct ones after the fact.

Bogus athletic profiles were made to look as though the students were qualified athletes in order to boost the kids’ chances of getting in — when they actually weren’t involved in sports.

“Some simply never showed up for the athletics, some showed up with an injury and I think some played briefly and then quit,” he said.

In all, 33 parents have been charged though Lelling hinted that more arrests could be coming.

“There are more than that, but I’m not prepared to give you a total,” he said at a press conference.

No students have been charged and it appears the majority of them had no idea about their parents’ alleged shady involvement. None of the schools were involved in Singer’s alleged scam.

Huffman, who starred in the ABC hit series “Desperate Housewives,” and Loughlin, who played Aunt Becky on the sitcom “Full House,” are facing charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.

In Huffman’s case, she and her husband allegedly made a “purported charitable contribution” of $15,000 in order to weasel her elder daughter into school, according to court papers cited by ABC.

She allegedly later made similar arrangements for her younger daughter — but then backed out.

Huffman has been married to fellow actor William H. Macy, who’s earned Emmy nominations for his role on “Shameless.”

The feds say they have recorded telephone calls with Huffman and a cooperating witness.

Loughlin, meanwhile, and her husband “agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC,” court documents said.

Authorities say they have emails from Loughlin to prove their charges.

A slew of college athletic coaches are also charged, including former Yale University women’s soccer coach Rudolph “Rudy” Meredith, who is accused of accepting payments from parents of college applicants.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Joseph Bonavolonta said charges are the result of a 10-month investigation dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues.” He said 38 people have been taken into custody, seven are working toward surrender and one is being actively pursued.

Four people — including Singer — are expected to plead guilty.

“We believe everyone charged here today had a role in cultivating a culture of corruption and greed,” Bonavolonta said. “Their actions were without a doubt insidious, selfish and shameful.”

Reps for Loughlin, Huffman and Macy didn’t immediately return messages."

Ernst, the document alleges, was part of a scheme to “facilitate the admission of students as recruited athletes, regardless of their athletic abilities.” The feds allege that in exchange for bribes of $2.7 million from a California non-profit called the Key Worldwide Foundation, Ernst “designated at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown.” In return, the document says, parents of those students paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Key Worldwide Foundation. Here’s a little bit more about Ernst:

• He came to Georgetown as head men’s and women’s coach in 2006.
He had previously been head men’s coach at the University of Pennsylvania and assistant men’s coach at Northwestern University. Ernst “will be a great asset to our University,” Bernard Muir, then the university’s athletics director, said at the time.

• He helped Michelle, Sasha, and Malia Obama with their tennis games.
“Michelle has a big backhand,” Ernst told the New York Times in 2014.

• He was inducted into the New England Tennis Hall of Fame in 2015.
“Sports like tennis and golf are such country club sports,” he told the Providence Journal that year. “But they’re also sports where you can do business with other people and play them for a lifetime.”

• He resigned from Georgetown in 2018 and later began coaching at the University of Rhode Island.
Ernst appears to have given no explanation for his resignation at the time. In a statement Tuesday, Georgetown University told the Georgetown Voice Ernst left “following an internal investigation that found he had violated University rules concerning admissions. Georgetown cooperated fully with the government’s investigation. We are reviewing the details of the indictment and will take appropriate action.”

• His country club membership could be in trouble.
If convicted, the government intends to seek forfeiture of several of Ernst’s assets, including a condo in Falmouth, Massachusetts, and “Chevy Chase country club membership, as owned by Ernst.”

One named former Georgetown men’s and women’s tennis coach Gordon “Gordie” Ernst as a defendant, and the other included the parents of four students admitted to Georgetown, at least three of whom eventually matriculated.

Ernst has been charged with racketeering conspiracy. The indictment alleges that between 2012 and 2018, Ernst accepted more than $2.7 million in bribes. In return, Ernst allegedly “designated at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown.”

Ernst began coaching Georgetown’s tennis teams in 2006. In a statement to the Voice on Tuesday, a university spokesperson wrote, “Ernst has not coached our tennis team since December 2017, following an internal investigation that found he had violated University rules concerning admissions.” According to a subsequent statement from a university spokesperson to the Voice, the “Admissions Office discovered irregularities in the athletic credentials of students who were being recruited to play tennis. This triggered Mr. Ernst being put on leave in Dec. 2017, an internal investigation, and Mr. Ernst’s separation with the University in 2018.”

A later email from university vice presidents Lisa Brown and Erik Smulson sent to the student body on Tuesday stated that Ernst had been placed on leave following the internal investigation and “separated from the university in 2018.” The email also stated that while the probe determined that Ernst violated university policy, Georgetown only learned about his alleged criminal misconduct when later contacted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

A press release dated July 1, 2018 regarding his resignation was removed from the Georgetown Athletics website early Tuesday afternoon. The release listed the effective date of his resignation as June 30, 2018. The release expresses gratitude “for the many efforts Gordie has made over the years to create a first class tennis program at the University, both athletically and academically,” and gives no indication that his departure was due to misconduct of any sort.

The university’s Tuesday statement called Ernst’s alleged criminal acts “an unprecedented breach of trust” and assured that “Georgetown cooperated fully with the government’s investigation.” The second indictment also explained that in early March at least one parent implicated in the racket was aware that Georgetown was investigating the allegations. According to the document, “Georgetown was conducting an internal investigation to determine why students who were not tennis players had been admitted to Georgetown through Ernst.”

In November 2018, the university implemented a new policy regarding the admission of student-athletes. The policy specifies that head coaches may only recommend candidates for admission “who they believe will contribute to the team from an athletic standpoint” and forbids athletic department staff from modifying the application of prospective student-athletes in any way. It also implements a system of periodic audits by the Office of Admissions and the athletic department “to determine whether any of the recruited student-athletes were not on the roster of the sport they were recruited for at Georgetown.” If any student-athlete is found to not be on the roster of the team for which they were recruited, the coach must submit a written explanation of the discrepancy.

Following his resignation from Georgetown, Ernst accepted a position coaching women’s tennis at the University of Rhode Island (URI). URI placed Ernst on administrative leave Tuesday, following the unsealing of the indictment. In a statement to the Voice, a URI spokesperson wrote that since Ernst was hired in August 2018, “he has not been involved in the recruitment of any current players nor in the signing of any new recruits.” URI’s director of athletics was not aware of the charges against Ernst until NBC contacted the department for a statement Tuesday morning, according to NBC’s Washington affiliate.

When asked whether the university communicated the results of its internal investigation to the University of Rhode Island, a university spokesperson said “Georgetown was unaware of any criminal activity by Gordon Ernst that would have warranted notifying the Justice Department or other employers.”

The indictment also names coaches at University of California, Los Angeles; Stanford; Wake Forest; and University of Southern California (USC). It alleges that the mislabeling of applicants as athletic recruits was part of a larger scheme run by the Edge College & Career Network, LLC, a for-profit college counseling business, which also involved falsifying standardized collegiate admissions test scores.

William Singer, a cooperating witness who founded the Edge College & Career Network, LLC, and the Key Worldwide Foundation, a registered non-profit corporation in California, worked as a middleman in facilitating many of the payments. Singer, who was not explicitly named in the indictment of the parents but was named in the indictment of the coaches, used the foundation as a front to receive payments from parents involved in the conspiracy. Singer then compensated coaches and exam proctors for mislabeling students as potential recruits and falsifying entrance exams, respectively.

A defendant identified in the court report, Douglas Hodge, had allegedly collaborated with both USC and Georgetown athletics employees to get his children into the colleges. According to Singer, one of Hodge’s children “had only a 50 percent chance ‘at best’ of getting into Georgetown based on her academic record but that ‘there may be an Olympic Sports angle we can use.’”

Both Georgetown and USC sent acceptance letters to Hodge’s children, and his daughter matriculated to USC.

“The federal government has alleged that USC is a victim in a scheme perpetrated against the university by a long-time Athletics Department employee, one current coach and three former coaching staff,” wrote USC President Wanda Austin in an email to its student body. “We will continue to cooperate fully with all law enforcement and regulatory investigations.”

In addition, Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez allegedly paid for their eldest daughter to take the SAT exam with a sympathetic proctor, then bribed Ernst to label her as a tennis recruit to Georgetown. The proctor, according to court documents, assisted the couple’s older daughter with the exam and “‘gloated’ with Elizabeth Henriquez and her daughter about the fact that they had cheated and gotten away with it.”

The couple paid the Key Worldwide Foundation, which distributed the money to both the proctor and Ernst. The Henriquezes’ receipt for their contribution to the foundation labeled the donation as allowing “the foundation to move forward with our plans to provide educational and self-enrichment programs to disadvantaged youth,” according to the indictment.

Singer alleges that they then directed $950,000 to Ernst, which he says was a lump-sum payment to facilitate the acceptance of the Henriquezes’ older daughter, and other potential students, to Georgetown as tennis recruits. The couple’s older daughter matriculated to Georgetown in the class of 2020 and, according to court documents, never participated in the school’s varsity tennis program.

Elisabeth Kimmel, the parent of another student who eventually matriculated to Georgetown, was also implicated in the scheme. According to court documents, the Kimmel family paid a total of $244,000 to secure their daughter’s acceptance to Georgetown as a tennis recruit. Again, the family used the Key Worldwide Foundation as a middleman to distribute the money to Ernst. The documents state that the Kimmels’ daughter was never a member of the varsity tennis team during her four years at Georgetown. The Kimmels are named again later in the report, having allegedly used similar channels to secure the acceptance of a younger son to USC.

Stephen Semprevivo, another defendant named in the indictment, also allegedly paid Ernst to facilitate his son’s acceptance to Georgetown as a tennis recruit. Following his son’s official acceptance to Georgetown, the Semprevivo Family Foundation paid the Key Worldwide Foundation $400,000, which was officially labeled as a “private contribution.” Singer alleges that he then disbursed that money to Ernst through the Key World Foundation, “representing payments for the purported recruitment of Semprevivo’s son.” Semprevivo’s son matriculated to Georgetown in the class of 2020, according to the court documents.

A spokesperson for Georgetown University did not elaborate on the specifics of potential consequences for Georgetown students implicated by the indictments.

This article has been updated. The headline has been edited from “Nationwide Admissions Scandal Implicates Georgetown, Former Tennis Coach Indicted” to reflect that the university itself has not been accused of admissions fraud.

On Saturday night, Mrs. Obama will celebrate her 50th birthday (which falls on Friday) with dancing and sweets throughout the state floor of the White House, drawing the nation’s attention away from her husband, at least for an evening. Guests will sip fine American wines, consume delicate macarons and be entertained — the expectation is by Beyoncé.

The mix of Hollywood and quirky individualism (American caterers, ready yourself for the onslaught of dessert-and-cocktails-only party requests) underscores the conflicting diptych of glamorous mystery woman and regular PTA mother that defines America’s first lady. Five years in, she has cobbled together a full life in Washington.

Sometimes she moves so discreetly through the area that a customer at a local Target store, not recognizing her, asked the first lady to reach for some highly perched toilet paper. At other times, Mrs. Obama is on plain view around town as a parent on the sidelines of the soccer games of her daughter Sasha, 12.

Marc Howard, whose daughter Zoe once played on the soccer team with Sasha, recalled how his daughter drained the tiny water bottle he had brought for her one hot Washington day on the field. Mrs. Obama lightheartedly chided him. “She said, ‘What kind of water bottle is that?’ and gave Zoe hers,” Mr. Howard said. “Those are things far away from the cameras.”

For all of her complaints about the scrutiny and isolation that come with living in the White House, Mrs. Obama has created a vibrant life in Washington as well as a policy agenda that at times dovetails with her husband’s, particularly on education. But she maintains a powerful zone of privacy, aided by discreet friends and a controlling East Wing. Accounts of her life here are culled from interviews with staff members, friends and parents of Malia and Sasha’s schoolmates. The accounts also draw on Mrs. Obama’s public speeches and comments, including a recent interview with People magazine.

While Mrs. Obama has been careful not to define herself or her role strictly through race, she has paid steadfast attention to her role as a model and mentor to minority children from poor backgrounds like her own, and has built much of her policy agenda around them.

“She is more self-determinative than prior first ladies because she very rarely allows herself to be drawn into distracting conversations,” said Carl Anthony, a historian of first ladies. In addition, he said, “She speaks to a demographic pretty much ignored by the White House by all first ladies except for Eleanor Roosevelt.” He cited trips Mrs. Obama has made to the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington and White House invitations she has extended to local working-class African-Americans.

The Obamas and their daughters usually eat together as a family at the White House, but the president and first lady also give small dinner parties at home with a mix of friends, notable local columnists and others. A typical menu is grilled shrimp with tomatoes and peppers, followed by lean fillet of steak (the first lady’s favorite) with potatoes and a selection of pies for dessert. Guests should not expect bread.

Mrs. Obama also frequents Washington’s restaurants of the moment. She has been spotted more than once sweeping into B.L.T. Steak on I Street with a gaggle of female friends, headed for a private room. She eats roasted cauliflower and stuffed grape leaves at Zaytinya and guacamole and margaritas at Oyamel. She has grown fond of Bibiana, an upscale Italian restaurant downtown.

“She is interested in local food,” said Eddie Gehman Kohan, the executive editor of obamafoodorama.com, an obsessive digital archive of the food ways and nutrition agenda of the Obamas. “Her typical meal is whatever is going on at the restaurant that is seasonal and best.”

Mrs. Obama’s group frequently includes her closest friend, Sharon Malone, a prominent obstetrician and wife of the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. Often on hand are old friends from Chicago, like Valerie B. Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president; Cindy S. Moelis, the director of the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships; and Angela Acree, who was one of Mrs. Obama’s roommates at Princeton.

Mrs. Obama also is known to wander the city’s museums and screen films at the White House, where she is partial to those that explore themes of poverty and struggle. This week she saw the movie “The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete,” a story about poor children in New York produced by the singer Alicia Keys.

“This is truly one of my favorite films this year,” Mrs. Obama told her guests, including Ms. Keys. “And it obviously has moved me, and it will be the guiding post for my work over the next three years.”

In hairstyle news, the bangs of 2013 are gone, replaced by a traditional first lady wave. As Mrs. Obama told the TV chef Rachael Ray last year: “This is my midlife crisis, the bangs. I couldn’t get a sports car. They won’t let me bungee jump. So instead, I cut my bangs.”

Then there is her fitness routine. Known for her biceps, Mrs. Obama has recently taken up yoga for strength training and takes vigorous walks through Rock Creek Park.

She takes occasional tennis lessons with Malia or has clinics with friends to work on their swing. In addition to her forehand, “Michelle has a big backhand,” said Gordie Ernst, who coaches mother and daughter.

One thing Mrs. Obama tends not to do as much as previous first ladies is travel. There is still time."
3,7,source-news-archive,,Joe for America.,https://archive.fo/um2G7,“Busted: Obama Family Linked to College Bribery Scandal as the Kids Tennis Coach Accepted Nearly $3 Million in Bribes.”,3/18/19,"Sasha and Malia Obama’s tennis instructor and the former Yale women’s soccer coach are among those indicted in sprawling college bribery scheme, which allegedly also involved actresses Lori Laughlin and Felicity Huffman. The scheme entailed getting students admitted to some of the top schools in the country as recruited athletes – regardless of athletic ability – and helping those applicants cheat on their entrance exams.
The Obama family tennis coach, who has also coached at multiple universities, allegedly pocketed $2.7 million as part of America’s largest college admissions scam. The University of Rhode Island tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, has been caught in the cross hairs of investigators and is testifying as to who got any help getting into an elite college – with or without qualifications. And what better qualifications than being The President’s daughters?
Ernst allegedly accepted nearly $3 million in bribes and in return helped a dozen students get onto the Georgetown’s tennis team, including kids who didn’t actually play the sport in a competitive fashion, according to the New York Post.
According to the same report from the New York Post, University of Rhode Island tennis coach Gordon Ernst has found himself at the center of a massive college admissions scandal. According to court documents, Ernst allegedly accepted $2.7 million as part of a larger fraud to shuffle unqualified students into Georgetown University, where he worked until 2018.
Ernst, who served as the personal tennis coach for the Obama family, allegedly helped 12 students gain admission to Georgetown University. The scam involved designating the students as star athletes so that they could be admitted to the university with lower grades and test scores. However, many of the students that Ernst brought into the university as tennis players had never played the game at all.
Fox News reports:
A tennis coach who worked with the family of former President Barack Obama was among the 50 people charged Tuesday in a college admissions scheme in which wealthy parents allegedly bribed coaches and others to get their children accepted to some of the top schools in the U.S.
Gordon Ernst, 52, was a former tennis coach at Georgetown University and the University of Rhode Island. He is accused of conspiracy to commit racketeering while he was at Georgetown.
Ernst was at Georgetown from 2012 to 2017 and was the personal instructor of former first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters, Sasha and Malia, according to the Providence Journal. None of the Obamas are implicated in the scandal in any way.
The scam involved designating the students as star athletes so that they could be admitted to the university with lower grades and test scores. However, many of the students that Ernst brought into the university as tennis players had never played the game at all.
The scam was allegedly perpetrated by William “Rick” Singer, who has pled guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges. In some instances, Singer allegedly deployed a 36-year-old man named Mark Riddell who would take exams for students. The entire scam is worth an estimated $25 million.
A statement was released by Georgetown on Tuesday which spoke to the conduct of Ernst during his time being employed by the university.
“Georgetown University is deeply disappointed to learn that former Tennis Coach Gordon Ernst is alleged to have committed criminal acts against the University that constitute an unprecedented breach of trust,” the statement from the university read.
December of 2017 was the last time that Ernst was employed by the school, the university explains. This is when Georgetown launched an internal investigation, leading them to find that Ernst had “violated University rules concerning admissions.”
Singer pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. The schools involved – Stanford, UCLA, Wake Forest, Yale, Georgetown, University of Texas, University of San Diego, USC – are not believed to have taken part in wrongdoing.
US Attorney for Massachusetts Andrew Lelling called the bribery scheme the ‘largest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the department of justice.’
‘In return for bribes, these coaches agreed to pretend that certain applicants were recruited, competitive athletes, when, in fact, the applicants were not,’ said Lelling. ‘As the coaches knew, the students’ athletic credentials had been fabricated.’
Lelling said the investigation is continuing and authorities believe other parents were involved. The schools themselves are not targets of the investigation, he said.
No students were charged. Authorities said in many cases the teenagers were not aware of what was going on.
Colleges moved quickly to discipline the coaches accused. Stanford fired Vandemoer, UCLA suspended its soccer coach, and Wake Forest did the same with its volleyball coach."

“The true depth of the devastation in Abaco and Grand Bahama is still unfolding. Persons are being evacuated to Eleuthera by land and sea from Abaco,” she told a press conference for the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) in the Bahamas capital, Nassau, on New Providence island. “While some will remain in Eleuthera or travel to Nassau or elsewhere to stay with family and friends there are still others who have nowhere to go.”

The United Nations estimates that 76,000 people in Grand Bahama and the Abaco islands have been left homeless by the hurricane and are in need of help.

Carl Smith, a Nema spokesperson, said 2,043 people displaced by Hurricane Dorian were in shelters on New Providence, while others stayed with friends or relatives. He said more shelters will be opened as they are needed.

“We are making improvements as we address this disaster and seemingly hopeless situation. But there’s hope, we’re making progress,” he said.

It comes after the health minister, Duane Sands, confirmed the death toll had increased to 50. The previous count, on Sunday, was 44.

The deadly category 5 storm, one of the most powerful Caribbean storms on record, brought gusts of more than 200mph and a storm surge of close to 24ft and devastation – flattening homes and destroying infrastructure.

Caribbean emergency officials said mortuary facilities on the island of New Providence were “overwhelmed” with bodies of victims, and the Caribbean Disaster Management Agency said bodies were being temporarily stored in refrigerated containers.

It also reported increased environmental health concerns in the northern islands and a stench of dead animals and potentially human bodies.

The government estimates that as many as 10,000 people from the Abaco Islands alone will need food, water and temporary housing while the northern region is cleared of debris. It is considering setting up tent or container cities.

Thousands of survivors left homeless by the disaster are arriving in Nassau by boat and plane seeking shelter after their homes and livelihoods were destroyed.

Some waited in hotel lobbies, others were driven by bus to shelters or sought accommodation from friends and family.

The storm, which also hit the Virgin Islands, North Carolina’s Outer Banks and near Halifax, Nova Scotia, is believed to have killed seven others in the south-east of the US and Puerto Rico.

Disney CEO Robert A. Iger said in a statement that the corporation “stands with the people of The Bahamas affected by Hurricane Dorian.” 

“We hope our $1 million donation will provide much-needed relief and help our neighbors, colleagues, and all those impacted by this devastating storm begin the long process of recovery as they work to put their lives and communities back together,” he continued.

The company said the $1 million donation will go toward supporting nonprofit relief agencies committed to recovery and rebuilding efforts in the region. The corporation also said it will be providing a “range of resources” to Disney employees in the Bahamas who were impacted by the hurricane.

The company said that Castaway Cay, a private island in the Bahamas that also acts as a port for the Disney Cruise Line, experienced “tropical force strength winds” during the storm. The company said it “employs more than 60 Bahamians from Abaco and Grand Bahama, as well as several employees from other Bahamian islands.”

Over the past few days, footage has been going viral across social media that shows devastation in the Bahamas brought on by Hurricane Dorian, which has already started to hit parts of the Florida coast and is expected to reach the Carolinas. 

Some videos show homes being flooded up to the second floor and waves overtaking the Freeport International Airport.

Jeff Vahle, the president of Disney Cruise Line, said that as needs in the Bahamas are being assessed, the company is “prepared to aid the relief and recovery efforts through funding, the provision of supplies and by providing support to our Bahamian Crew Members.” 

“Disney continues to monitor Hurricane Dorian and will coordinate on an ongoing basis with nonprofit organizations on emergency response efforts,” the corporation also said.

“This includes sharing lifesaving information with families before and during emergencies, prepositioning supplies at-the-ready to respond rapidly to natural disasters, and providing resources to activate large-scale responses as needed in the event of a disaster,"" it added.

Jordan, who owns property in the Bahamas and frequently visits the islands, said he was “devastated to see the destruction” brought on by Dorian, adding that “my heart goes out to everyone who is suffering and to those who have lost loved ones.”


Dorian’s nearly two-week tale of destruction came to an end over the weekend, with the death toll totaling at least 50 in the Bahamas, according to multiple reports. The total death toll could be as high as 3,000, Bahamas Press reported Sunday.

But as Hurricane Dorian threatened the east coast, President Donald Trump spread information that was overblown or inaccurate. 

Dorian was a challenging storm to forecast. Still, Trump’s exaggerations were easily avoidable.

Trump tweeted the storm was headed to Alabama, only for his warnings to be batted down by the National Weather Service in Birmingham minutes later.

He also said he hadn’t heard of a storm reaching Category 5, despite acknowledging the toll of such a hurricane on Florida’s Panhandle at a rally four months ago. 

""The public has come to expect factual information from presidents, and Trump’s willingness to offer casual speculative thoughts about such matters is unusual,"" said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University professor of history and journalism. ""Trump’s loose talk at best is embarrassing to him. At worst, it contributes to misinformation that can mislead the public.""

The White House did not respond to our questions.

Americans looking for reliable sources of information ahead of a massive hurricane like Dorian should consult the National Hurricane Center. Government-run emergency management agencies such as FloridaDisaster.org or county agencies also provide useful information about evacuations and shelters.

Trump’s scary tweet about Alabama
Trump warned several times Sept. 1 that the Atlantic storm would hit several states much harder than expected — even reaching as far west as Alabama. Meteorologists quickly corrected this sweeping projection.

It started with a tweet at 10:51 a.m.: ""In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!""

Twenty minutes later, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., corrected Trump without mentioning his name:

""Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx,"" the weather service tweeted.

Trump continued to muse about the storm’s reach, saying at FEMA headquarters, ""And Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. ... So, for Alabama, just please be careful also.""

Trump may have been referencing a NOAA map showing a 5% chance of tropical storm force winds nipping the southeast corner of Alabama. 



After days of news coverage critical of Trump’s comments about Alabama, Trump gave a televised update about Hurricane Dorian on Sept. 4 next to what he called the ""original chart"" of the storm’s path. It had been altered to extend the storm’s cone to part of Alabama with a black circle.


President Donald Trump holds a chart as he talks with reporters after receiving a briefing on Hurricane Dorian in the Oval Office of the White House Sept. 4, 2019, in Washington. (AP)

""It was going to hit not only Florida but Georgia, it was going toward the Gulf, that was what was originally projected,"" he said.

The White House and NOAA did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions about who circled Alabama on the map. When reporters asked Trump whether the map had been drawn on with a Sharpie, Trump said, ""I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know.""

But a White House photo from Aug. 29 does not show Alabama in NOAA’s hurricane cone map.  And NOAA’s Dorian graphics archive for late August through Sept. 1 shows that the cone was centered over Florida and the Atlantic southeast coast — not Alabama.

Trump unfamiliar with Cat 5
As the storm intensified, Trump said he was not sure he had heard of a storm reaching Category 5. That’s the highest tier of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale for storms with sustained winds of 157 mph and higher. 

 ""We don’t even know what’s coming at us. All we know is it’s possibly the biggest. I’m not sure that I’ve ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I’ve seen some Category 4s; you don’t even see them that much. But a Category 5 is something that I don’t know that I’ve even heard the term other than I know it’s there. That’s the ultimate. And that’s what we have, unfortunately,"" Trump said.

What makes Trump’s comment more confounding is that he visited an Air Force base in northwestern Florida that sustained considerable damage from Hurricane Michael. That storm made history in 2018 as the first to hit the United States as a Category 5 since 1992. 

Speaking of Hurricane Michael at a May 8, 2019, rally, Trump said, ""I've just come from a stop at Tyndall Air Force Base, where I saw the devastating effects of that Category 5 hurricane, Category 5. Never heard about Category 5s before, a Category 5 is big stuff.""

There were three previous storms that made landfall in the continental United States as a Category 5: a Labor Day storm in the Florida Keys in 1935, Camille on the Gulf Coast in 1969 and Andrew in south Florida in 1992, according to NOAA. (The 1928 San Felipe Hurricane made landfall as a Category 5 Hurricane on Puerto Rico).

Dorian hit the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm Sept. 1. With sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, it tied the record with the Labor Day hurricane in 1935. It weakened as it approached Florida’s east coast.

Update: We updated this story Sept. 4 at 6:40 p.m. to include news of Trump's hurricane map with a black circle around parts of Alabama."

It traces back to an anonymous online persona claiming to be a government insider on a mission to expose the ""deep state"" allegedly working against Trump.

Q’s vague and cryptic ""breadcrumbs"" posted on fringe online forums have become fodder for a wide-ranging conspiracy theory embraced by Trump’s supporters that casts him as victorious over evil forces.


The term ""QAnon"" has been used in reference to Q and its followers and to describe the broad conspiracy theory and movement.

It’s not entirely unusual for followers of conspiracy theories to attend Trump’s rallies — Trump himself is known for promoting such theories. But it was jarring to see a physical representation at an event for a U.S. president.

Here’s a closer look at the QAnon phenomenon making its way from online forums to Trump rallies.

Q’s unclear message
Q’s posts started last fall. The Q in its anonymous name is billed as a reference to a security clearance needed for high-level government information.

It’s difficult to figure out Q’s exact message, and varying plot lines exist. But the general idea is that presidents before Trump were conspiring with evil groups, including pedophile rings, and that the military convinced Trump to run for president in order to stop them, The Daily Beast reporter Will Sommer wrote in a July 6 article.

The belief is that the alleged perpetrators will end up in prison at the coming of ""the storm."" The ""storm"" latches on to comments Trump made to reporters in October during a photo opportunity with senior military officers: ""You guys know what this represents? Maybe it’s the calm before the storm.""

The conspiracy theory is far-fetched and unproven. But the QAnon movement is compelling to some people because it’s like a puzzle, said Kathryn Olmsted, a history professor at the University of California, Davis.

""The alleged leaker puts out clues for his followers to decode. And they work with one another to figure it out,"" she said. ""That’s very appealing.""

In their view, Olmsted said, ""there’s a group of insiders who control the U.S. government, and brave citizens need to uncover the truth to stop them.""

The nuggets of information Q leaves are abstract enough that they can’t necessarily be disproven, said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida.

He offered this example: When Trump at a July White House meeting was saying he had ""full faith"" in the U.S. intelligence agencies, the lights briefly went out in the room.

Fenster said some connected that to a ""dark to light"" QAnon clue. Q reportedly has used that phrase in several drops, including one that said: ""Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. A week to remember. Dark to light. Blackout necessary. Q.""

As the lights went out and back on, Trump said: ""Whoops, they just turned off the light. That must be the intelligence agencies."" He called the incident ""strange.""

The QAnon conspiracy theory appeal
Usually, people who support the losing candidate in an election are more inclined to believe conspiracy theories, Olmsted said, but in this case it’s the winning side that’s embracing these theories.

QAnon ""is hitting the nail in the head"" for Trump supporters, said Joseph Uscinski, a political science associate professor at the University of Miami.

""Conspiracy theories are believed by people who are already predisposed,"" Uscinski said. ""It matches their dispositions.""

Actress Roseanne Barr and former baseball player Curt Schilling, both Trump supporters, seem to back the QAnon conspiracy, posting links about it on their social media pages.

Conspiracy theories aren’t just limited to Trump’s supporters, however. Everyone is susceptible.

Many people who oppose Trump are extremely interested on whether Putin has compromising material on Trump, said Fenster, the UF professor. In order to prove this, many spend a lot of time reading about Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort believing there’s a conspiracy afoot, he said.

""It’s important to understand that people on the right and left have their own theories and when they believe (a conspiracy theory), they believe it because they think it’s true,"" Uscinski said.

How conspiracy theories can encourage action
In the short term, conspiracy theories could prompt violent attacks against government officials or buildings, which is what happened in Oklahoma City in the 1990s, said Olmsted, the UC Davis professor. Because the latest theories are against the government, they make it hard for the government and democratic process to function.

In June, an armed man drove an armored vehicle to the Hoover Dam and blocked traffic. He had a sign that said ""Release the OIG report."" The Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General had already released a report related to the conduct of FBI officials during the investigation of Clinton’s emails.

But followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory believed there was a second, more damning report that would expose the ""deep state."" Police arrested the man and no one was injured. The Las Vegas Review-Journal in July reported that the man faces terrorism charges and has written letters from jail to Trump and other elected officials. While his letters don’t explain a motive, they include a signoff popular among QAnon followers, the newspaper reported.

Before QAnon, there was Pizzagate. The Pizzagate conspiracy theory spread online before Election Day after WikiLeaks released emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager. Online forum users noticed that Podesta corresponded with the owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington to discuss a potential Clinton fundraiser.

A fake theory emerged claiming that Podesta’s repeated use of the word ""pizza"" in emails was actually a code word for pedophilia, and that the pizzeria was allegedly the base for secret rooms in which Clinton and her allies kidnapped and imprisoned children to be sexually abused, tortured or even sacrificed in the name of Satan. The theory alleged Democrats in both Clinton’s campaign and the federal government colluded to hide the abuse.

In December 2016, a North Carolina man entered the pizzeria with an assault rifle to ""self-investigate"" the claims. Police said the man pointed his gun at a worker (who fled) and then started firing the rifle inside the restaurant. The suspect surrendered to police and there were no reported injuries.

In the long term, anti-government conspiracy theories threaten democracy.

""These theories could undermine faith in the electoral process,"" Olmsted said. ""The losing side could refuse to concede.""

Trump’s own dance with conspiracy theories
While conspiracy theories have been around throughout American history, what’s new now is that the president himself supports these theories, which elevates them in politics and pop culture.

""That’s unprecedented,"" Olmsted said.

A conspiracy theory often repeated by Trump is that there’s been widespread voter fraud in California and other places, which explains his loss in the popular vote to Clinton. (Pants on Fire)

The false claim that 3 million votes in the presidential election were cast by people in the country illegally was peddled by the conspiracy-minded website, Infowars, run by Alex Jones. Trump appeared on Jones’s show in 2015 while campaigning for the presidency and toward the end of the interview, Trump said, ""Your reputation is amazing.""

""Alex Jones used to be on the paranoid margins; now he claims that he inspires the president of the United States,"" Olmsted said. ""Trump is giving credibility to fringe figures and theories.""

Some of Trump’s conspiracies pre-date his presidency.

— Trump for years promoted a debunked theory that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and thus ineligible to be president. After falsely claiming Clinton and her 2008 campaign started the birther controversy, Trump said, ""I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period."" (Full Flop)

— He said that in the Philippines more than a century ago, Gen. John Pershing ""took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood,"" and shot 49 Muslim rebels. ""The 50th person, he said, ‘You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.’ And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem."" (Pants on Fire)

— He said Sen. Ted Cruz’s father ""was with Lee Harvey Oswald"" before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. (Pants on Fire)

— He said, ""I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" as the World Trade Center collapsed. (Pants on Fire)

After the Tampa rally, White House reporters asked press secretary Sarah Sanders whether Trump ""encouraged the support of people who showed up last night in these QAnon and Blacks for Trump fringe groups.""

""The president condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual, and certainly doesn't support groups that would promote that type of behavior,"" Sanders said at the Aug. 1 briefing."
4,10,source-factcheck,,politifact,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/sep/05/donald-trump/trump-said-almost-all-models-predicted-dorian-woul/,Trump said ‘almost all models predicted’ Dorian would hit Alabama. He’s wrong,9/5/19,"Armed with spaghetti models and a Sharpie-doctored map, President Donald Trump defended his efforts to declare that once upon a time, Alabama was poised to face Hurricane Dorian’s wrath.

He even went so far as to say that there was a 95% chance that Alabama was on the hurricane’s path.

But Trump’s receipts don’t check out. This is the story of how the president mangled government models of the storm to blow the forecast way out of proportion and misinform Americans. 

The White House did not answer our questions

But by the end of the day the White House issued a statement by Rear Admiral Peter J. Brown, Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor, who defended Trump. Brown said that he shared with Trump the spaghetti models that showed possible storm impacts outside the official forecast cone and that forecasts showed the possibility of tropical storm force winds hitting Alabama.

Doubling down on Alabama’s overblown risk
Over several days, Trump heard criticism from the media and meteorologists about his weekend warnings that even Alabama would ""get a piece of"" Dorian or ""will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.""

So, as he briefed reporters on the latest updates Sept. 4, he asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan to display a chart of the ""original"" forecast. 

#Sharpiegate was born: The hurricane’s cone had been extended in black ink to include a section of southeast Alabama, even though it didn’t match anything produced by the government’s hurricane forecasters. 

Speaking again to reporters Sept. 4, Trump said he ""didn’t know"" who altered the map. Trump also had this to say, alluding to yet another model that he thought would prove his point: 

""I know that Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought it would get it as a piece of it. It was supposed to go — actually, we have a better map than that, which is going to be presented, where we had many lines going directly — many models — each line being a model.  And they were going directly through. And, in all cases, Alabama was hit — if not lightly, in some cases pretty hard. Georgia, Alabama — it was a different route. They actually gave that a 95% chance probability.""

Forecasters did not give Alabama a 95% chance of being hit, and the ""better map"" Trump shared hours later in a tweet also did not show most models hitting Alabama.

Case not closed
Trump’s tweet showed an Aug. 28 model of spaghetti plots for the hurricane’s path appearing in countless jiggly lines aimed at the southeastern United States.

""This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!""

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019
The spaghetti plots show various models up to 10 days out and requires professional interpretation. The National Hurricane Center examines those models and then comes up with a five-day forecast. 

""The 'spaghetti tracks' from the forecast model are useful for hurricane forecasters to consider,"" said Judith Curry, an atmospheric scientist and founder of the Climate Forecast Applications Network. ""But they are easily misinterpreted by the public.""

And apparently, the president.

FEATURED FACT-CHECK

""This idea that it's the pandemic of the unvaccinated, it's just a total lie.""

By Gabrielle Settles • November 8, 2021
""There was absolutely not ever a 95% chance that Alabama would get hit, let alone ‘pretty hard’ or ‘in all cases,’"" said Brian McNoldy, a tropical cyclone researcher at the University of Miami who has been critical of Trump’s statements about Hurricane Dorian and other topics. 

A spaghetti plot shows multiple computer models that predict a storm’s path up to 10 days. There are about 100 models from various sources including the government and private firms. Some meteorologists only pay attention to some of them. The key is not to pluck out a particular strand but to look for consensus and watch the trend over time.

While the graphic Trump tweeted did show a few lines going through Alabama, McNoldy said the lines ""are not all equals and should not be interpreted as such.""

""Even so, only a small handful were there, hardly a 95% chance or ‘in all cases,’ "" he said.

The fine print of the graphic says ""If anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product.""

As for Trump’s potentially Sharpied cone map, that also looks like a case of exaggerating one of many five-day forecasts. 

One map from Aug. 30 showed the outer edge of the five-day cone just barely nipping the southeast corner of Alabama. Most from around that time showed the cone centered over Florida and the southeast Atlantic coast.

The edge of the cone represents a two-thirds probability of the center of the storm tracking within it, using average track errors from the previous five years, McNoldy said.

By the weekend, there was growing consensus that Hurricane Dorian would turn north before it eventually reached Florida, Curry said.

""There was never a substantial probability of it reaching Alabama,"" she said.

There was a period of time when the Gulf really was threatened in the extended range beyond five days, said Keith G. Blackwell and Andrew Murray, two University of South Alabama meteorologists. 

But the five-day forecasts from the National Hurricane Center focused on Florida and then the southeastern coast days before Trump started on Alabama. (Trump has since highlighted an Alabama National Guard warning on Twitter about the storm forecast. The view was not shared by the meteorologists we reached.)

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s advisory showing tropical storm force wind probabilities did show at certain points a chance that Alabama would face strong winds over the next few days. For example, a 2 p.m. Aug. 30 update showed anywhere from a 5 to 30% chance that Alabama would face winds at 39 miles per hour.

Ultimately, there was a very small chance that Dorian could have reached Alabama, but Trump overstated what earlier predictions showed.

""In no way was Alabama a likely target, but there was a small chance that Dorian could have entered the Gulf of Mexico,"" Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach said. ""But, I think the key point is that NOAA never discussed that scenario, because it was likely at least one week out from when this guidance was available.""

Our ruling
Trump tweeted that originally ""almost all models predicted"" Dorian would hit Alabama.

He linked to a spaghetti models map that showed various models through the next 10 days. While some of those models showed Dorian hitting Alabama, Trump has grossly overstated what it showed.

The National Hurricane Center takes these models and then comes up with a five-day forecast. It’s ridiculous for him to use the models to conclude that it showed almost all predicted the storm would hit Alabama, which matches our definition of Pants on Fire.

Critics of President Biden seized upon some stray remarks at a news conference in December 2021.",12/3/21,"In December 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden sincerely stated that Anthony Fauci, and not he, was the de facto president."
5,2,source-news,,Mediaite,https://www.mediaite.com/tv/biden-thanks-fauci-and-jokes-that-hes-the-real-president-i-sincerely-mean-it/,“Biden Thanks Fauci and Jokes (?) That He’s the Real President: ‘I Sincerely Mean It.’”,12/2/21,"President Joe Biden delivered remarks on Thursday at the National Institute of Health, during which he thanked medical professionals and health officials for their hard work during the pandemic. He also singled out Dr. Anthony Fauci for praise with a somewhat eyebrow-raising quip.

In a joke that would surely be called “expert trolling” by MAGA Twitter in the reverse situation, Biden made a joke about something that happens to be a favorite insult/conspiracy theory about the Biden administration in some quarters on the right. Namely, that Biden isn’t pulling the strings in his own presidency.

Dr. Fauci is a favorite target in this particular scenario as the true power behind the throne, and Biden’s joke went right to it, whether intentionally or by happy coincidence.


“I’ve seen more of Dr. Fauci than I have my wife. We kid each other,” said Biden. “Hey look, who is president? Fauci!”

The joke was framed with the remark about seeing Fauci more than the First Lady, meaning the joke was between the two of them about the demands on Biden’s time. Presumably.

“But all kidding aside, I sincerely mean it,” Biden continued. But before you panic, understand that he was referring to the sincerity of his gratitude for those dealing with the pandemic and keeping him informed on the latest information.

Probably.

Still, we can surely expect to see this joke with sinister lighting and music in a YouTube or Rumble video fairly soon.

It seems like a pretty good time to join Citizen, the app that alerts you to police activity in your general vicinity—what with, you know, the president ordering militarized police forces to attack peaceful protestors in cities around the country. The app pings you with a notification when someone in your contacts has joined, and over the course of the week, it appears that new downloaders include Gagosian-employed gadabout Derek Blasberg, David Zwirner staffer-slash-scion Marlene Zwirner, and art advisor Astrid Hill. But one new Citizen downloader, according to a screenshot sent by a source, intrigues more than most. Earlier this week, it appears that someone has given back phone privileges to incarcerated art-dealing legend Mary Boone.



Could it be that Boone has managed to get out early, having served just 13 months of a 30-month sentence for tax evasion? And that now, instead of serving time for committing a crime, she’s downloading iPhone apps that allow her to track other crimes instead?

Well, as it turns out, after plugging her inmate number into a prison database, Wet Paint can confirm that Mary Boone has been released from the Federal Correctional Facility in Danbury, Connecticut, and is now in a halfway house in Brooklyn ahead of a return to home confinement. A spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed she was transferred out of Danbury on May 27.

The move appears to be a response to the threat Boone and fellow older inmates faced after several prisoners tested positive for COVID-19. In late May, US District Judge Michael Shea issued an order accelerating home confinement for FCI Danbury inmates with heightened risk of infection. And as for the iPhone activity: As a resident of a reentry and treatment facility, Boone is allowed to use her cell phone.

Bureau of Prisons officials declined to elaborate on how long she will be kept at the New York Residential Reentry Management field office, the Brooklyn facility located next to Industry City, before leaving the halfway house for home confinement. Her current release date is July 1, 2021, so if she is allowed to spend the last six months of her term at home, which is typical for those on good behavior, she could be out of the halfway house by early next year. Members of the Chelsea art-dealing cognoscenti can take heart that Boone is now out of prison and back in New York, the town she once ruled over.

 

JEFFREY EPSTEIN, A PHONE CALL AWAY FROM THE ART WORLD

Take a look at the names in your phone contacts. Some you know well, others not as well. But you did get their number at some point. And that is the same relationship that Jeffrey Epstein had with everyone in his little black book, the trove of names and phone numbers that the group Anonymous leaked last week, putting it in the public record. Gawker leaked the thing years ago, so it’s not exactly new, but Epstein is as relevant as ever. Right now, as the stuck-at-home nation is watching the gut-wrenching Netflix documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich and learning about the heinous abuse Epstein callously committed over decades (fine, “allegedly” committed—he died before trial), Wet Paint spent a few hours trawling through the tome to find art-world figures that were just a phone call away.

There are a ton of top-tier contemporary art collectors, including billionaire Nicolas Berggruen, publisher Conrad Black, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, hedge-fund billionaire and MoMA benefactor Glenn Dubin, Miami private museum owners Patricia and Gustavo Cisneros, NetJets exec Mark Booth, Dr. Samantha Boardman (wife of developer and mega-collector Aby Rosen), Palm Beach sugar baron José “Pepe” Fanjul, industrial heir playboy Mick Flick, fashion designer and filmmaker Tom Ford, lit agent Linda Janklow, collector and gallerist Adam Lindemann, banker and erstwhile Gagosian courtroom bête noire Ron Perelman, shipping heir Constantine Niarchos, Hard Rock Cafe founder Peter Morton, San Francisco scions Nick and Thomas Pritzker, late Hong Kong businessman Sir David Tang, banking heir Édouard de Rothschild, and Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary founder Francesca von Hapsburg.

Some named in the book were active in the art world beyond simply collecting (ie, being a well-connected rich person). They include: art advisor Barbara Guggenheim, LACMA board member Casey Wasserman, Broadway director Julie Taymor, former Sotheby’s owner Alfred Taubman and his son Bobby Taubman, singers Courtney Love and Rufus Wainwright, Pablo Picasso grandson Olivier Widmaier Picasso, Artsy board member Bob Pittman, Duran Duran rocker Simon Le Bon, artist Anh Duong, artist Hugo Guinness, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, art-gala socialite Marjorie Gubelmann, Whitney board member Robert Hurst, high-profile art publicist Nadine Johnson, and—last but certainly not least—Genesis frontman Phil Collins, the world’s leading collector of artifacts from The Alamo.

FIERY FEUD LIGHTS UP LA INSTAGRAM

Perhaps the most protracted and explosive social-media fracas of quarantine happened this week, and it’s got the Los Angeles gallery scene in a tizzy. Here’s the back-and-forth as it happened.

This week, Esther Kim Varet, the owner of venerable LA gallery Various Small Fires, posted a since-deleted note to her Instagram. The artist and writer Keith J. Varadi responded by reposting a screenshot of the original on his Instagram, appending this caption: “The art world can be so fucking oblivious to how the rest of the world lives.”


The post was similar to several other screen-grab call-outs Varardi has posted this week, reflecting on how collectors and gallery owners are proceeding with their cushy lives amid the protests that have engulfed the nation. He pointed out that Susan Hort got takeout from The Palm in Tribeca, Niels Kantor was golfing in Beverly Hills, etc.

Then, Varet responded to the call-out, messaging Varadi on Instagram, according to a screenshot Varadi posted.


And then—out of nowhere—it appeared to all be over: Varet posted a long apology to Instagram, and Varadi reposted it with a heartfelt note of conciliation. Everyone was friends! Hooray!


But the détente did not last. Late on Wednesday, Varadi uploaded a multi-page post that alleged that Varet recanted her apology and said she would be putting Varadi in touch with her lawyers to sue him for extortion. You can read through the whole post here. It’s a roller coaster.


And then, at 2:00 a.m. Los Angeles time, Varet posted this comment on Varadi’s feed:

In a statement, Hilde Lynn Helphenstein, the Various Small Fires digital director who also runs the popular Instagram account @jerrygogosian and was named by Varadi in his post, said she “categorically den[ies]” that she threatened to use her influence to damage Varadi’s reputation, calling his claim “a fiction.”

Varet provided a statement as well. It reads: “Keith was right. Those posts were in poor taste, and I had the opportunity to re-examine myself in this important time. The art world is a place of privilege and blindspots continue to be important to identify. There is no tolerance for ignorance in the art world anymore, and I have made a commitment to be a part of this change.”

What would you do if you possessed the awesome power of controlling something as influential and epoch-defining as… the official Paddle8 Instagram handle? Well, dream no longer: for the right price, you can take that puppy and its 82,200 followers and do whatever you damn well please with it. Due to the bankruptcy of the failed online art selling platform that once had the clout to throw decent-to-OK brunches at Soho Beach House during Art Basel Miami Beach, the intellectual property consultant Nevium is selling off any assets related to the company. This includes not only the Instagram account, but also the Twitter handle (and its 36,000 followers!) as well as a Facebook account that got 38,000 likes while the people who ran the company into the ground were posting to it (surely you can do better). And while the YouTube page only has, um, *checks the numbers*, 76 subscribers, you can up that right quick, can’t ya pal? Perhaps more interesting on an anthropological level is the client and transaction database, which will tell a rich story of a now-bygone era of online art start-ups inside a very frothy bubble.

 

POP QUIZ
Last week’s Pop Quiz, well, it was a tough one. Only a handful of you correctly guessed that the actor in the blurry Zoom pic was Orlando Bloom, and behind him was a Lucien Smith “rain painting”—one of which sold for more than $370,000 at auction in 2014. Bloom bought it from LA dealer-Svengali-art advisor Stefan Simchowitz, who got it from Morán Morán, then known as OHWOW.

PARTING SHOT"
6,3,source-news,,"New York Magazine,",https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/,“Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery.”,10/28/02,"e comes with cash to burn, a fleet of airplanes, and a keen eye for the ladies — to say nothing of a relentless brain that challenges Nobel Prize–winning scientists across the country — and for financial markets around the world. Ever since the Post’s “Page Six” ran an item about the president’s late-September visit to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker – on his new benefactor’s customized Boeing 727 – the question of the day has been: Who in the world is Jeffrey Epstein?

It’s a life full of question marks. Epstein is said to run $15 billion for wealthy clients, yet aside from Limited founder Leslie Wexner, his client list is a closely held secret. A former Dalton math teacher, he maintains a peripatetic salon of brilliant scientists yet possesses no bachelor’s degree. For more than ten years, he’s been linked to Manhattan-London society figure Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the mysteriously deceased media titan Robert Maxwell, yet he lives the life of a bachelor, logging 600 hours a year in his various planes as he scours the world for investment opportunities. He owns what is said to be Manhattan’s largest private house yet runs his business from a 100-acre private island in St. Thomas.


Power on Wall Street has generally accrued to those who have made their open bids for it. Soros. Wasserstein. Kravis. Weill. The Sturm und Drang of their successes and failures has been played out in public. Epstein breaks the mold. Most everyone on the Street has heard of him, but nobody seems to know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way he likes it.

“My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won’t get a straight answer from him,” says one well-known investor. “He once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I’ve also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It’s like looking at the Wizard of Oz – there may be less there than meets the eye.”

Says another prominent Wall Streeter: “He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness. The whole thing is weird.”

The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully coiffed head of silver hair, he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A raspy Brooklyn accent betrays his Coney Island origins. He spends an hour and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. He is an enthusiastic member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.

He dresses casually — jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers — and is rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. “It feels like a dress,” he told one friend.

Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here’s the thing about Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. “I invest in people — be it politics or science. It’s what I do,” he has said to friends. And his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a species represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa, “If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world’s greatest politician.”

“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science,” Clinton says through a spokesman. “I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.”

Before Clinton, Epstein’s rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to be speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell. While they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell has longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons Epstein has not reciprocated in kind. “It’s a mysterious relationship that they have,” says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. “In one way, they are soul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It’s a nice conventional relationship, where they serve each other’s purposes.”

Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-octane than Epstein’s, lent a little pizzazz to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed, at a party at Maxwell’s house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see Russian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-educated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her own helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello’s on Madison Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. “You may read about Jeffrey in the social columns, but there is much more to him than that,” says Jeffrey T. Leeds of the private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. “He’s a talented money manager and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual, though, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-promoter.”

Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High School. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper Union from 1969 to 1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and attended NYU’s Courant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the heart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between 1973 and 1975, Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.

By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams–in–Dead Poets Society type of figure, wowing his high-school classes with passionate mathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that he said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton? You should be working on Wall Street — why don’t you give my friend Ace Greenberg a call.”

Epstein was in many respects the perfect candidate for Greenberg’s consideration. Greenberg, a senior partner at Bear Stearns at the time and a legendary trader in his own right, has long made it clear that it’s the hungry, brilliant guys lacking the fancy degrees that he favors at Bear. They even have an acronym: PSDs — poor, smart, and a deep desire to be rich. It was a description that fit Epstein to a T. He was a Brooklyn guy with a motor for a brain, and while he did love teaching, this close-up view of the rarefied Upper East Side life of his students’ gave him a taste for the big time.

So in 1976, he dropped everything and reported to work at Bear Stearns, where he started off as a junior assistant to a floor trader at the American Stock Exchange. His ascent was rapid.

At the time, options trading was an arcane and dimly understood field, just beginning to take off. To trade options, one had to value them, and to value them, one needed to be able to master such abstruse mathematical confections as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For Epstein, breaking down such models was pure sport, and within just a few years he had his own stable of clients. “He was not your conventional broker saying ‘Buy IBM’ or ‘Sell Xerox,’ ” says Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne. “Given his mathematical background, we put him in our special-products division, where he would advise our wealthier clients on the tax implications of their portfolios. He would recommend certain tax-advantageous transactions. He is a very smart guy and has become a very important client for the firm as well.”

In 1980, Epstein made partner, but he had left the firm by 1981. Working in a bureaucracy was not for him; what’s more, in rubbing up against ever greater sums of money during his time at Bear, he began to feel the need to grab his own piece of the action.

In 1982, according to those who know Epstein, he set up his own shop, J. Epstein and Co., which remains his core business today. The premise behind it was simple: Epstein would manage the individual and family fortunes of clients with $1 billion or more. Which is where the mystery deepens. Because according to the lore, Epstein, in 1982, immediately began collecting clients. There were no road shows, no whiz-bang marketing demos – just this: Jeff Epstein was open for business for those with $1 billion–plus.

His firm would be different, too. He was not here just to offer investment advice; he saw himself as the financial architect of every aspect of his client’s wealth — from investments to philanthropy to tax planning to security to assuaging the guilt and burdens that large sums of inherited wealth can bring on. “I want people to understand the power, the responsibility, and the burden of their money,” he said to a colleague at the time.

As a teacher at Dalton, he had witnessed firsthand the troubled attitudes of some of the poor little rich kids under his charge; at Bear, he had come to the realization that, counterintuitively, the more money you had, the more anxious you became. For a middle-class kid from Brooklyn, it just didn’t make sense.

From the get-go, his business was successful. But the conditions for investing with Epstein were steep: He would take total control of the billion dollars, charge a flat fee, and assume power of attorney to do whatever he thought was necessary to advance his client’s financial cause. And he remained true to the $1 billion entry fee. According to people who know him, if you were worth $700 million and felt the need for the services of Epstein and Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you from Epstein.

It’s nice work if you can get it. Epstein runs a lean operation, and those close to him say that his actual staff — based here in Manhattan at the Villard House (home to Le Cirque); New Albany, Ohio; and St. Thomas, where he reincorporated his company seven years ago (now called Financial Trust Co.) — numbers around 150 and is purely administrative. When it comes to putting these billions to work in the markets, it is Epstein himself making all the investment calls — there are no analysts or portfolio managers, just twenty accountants to keep the wheels greased and a bevy of assistants — many of them conspicuously attractive young women — to organize his hectic life. So assuming, conservatively, a fee of .5 percent (he takes no commissions or percentages) on $15 billion, that makes for a management fee of $75 million a year straight into Jeff Epstein’s pocket. Nice work indeed.

It has been rumored that Linda Wachner and David Rockefeller have been clients, too, but both parties deny any such relationship. What’s more, who ever heard of a financial adviser turning down $500 million accounts? All the speculation and mystery has proved fertile ground for some alternative Jeffrey Epstein stories – the most bizarre of which has him playing the piano (he is classically trained) for high rollers in a Manhattan piano bar in the mid-eighties.

Another focus of curiosity is the relationship that Epstein has with his patron and mentor Leslie Wexner, founder and chairman of the Columbus, Ohio–based Limited chain of women’s-clothing stores. Wexner, who is said to be worth more than $2.5 billion by Forbes, became an Epstein client in 1987. “It’s a weird relationship,” says another Wall Streeter who knows Epstein. “It’s just not typical for someone of such enormous wealth to all of a sudden give his money to some guy most people have never heard of.” The Wexner-Epstein relationship is indeed a multifaceted one.

Given the secrecy that envelops Epstein’s client list, some have speculated that Wexner is the primary source of Epstein’s lavish life — but friends leap to his defense. “Let me tell you: Jeffrey Epstein has other clients besides Wexner. I know because some of them are my clients,” says noted m&a lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. “I sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn’t take him. Said the account was too small. Both the client and I were amazed. But that’s Jeffrey.”

Epstein’ s current residence in Manhattan — a 45,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on East 71st Street — was originally bought by Wexner for $13 million in 1989. Wexner poured many millions into a full gut renovation, then turned it over to Epstein in 1995 after he got married. One story has Epstein paying only a dollar for it, though others say he paid full market price, which would have been in the neighborhood of $20 million. Epstein then undertook his own $10 million gut renovation (special features: closed-circuit TV and a heated sidewalk in front of the house for melting snow), saying to friends: “I don’t want to live in another person’s house.”

There are other houses as well, including a sweeping villa in Palm Beach and a custom-built 51,000-square-foot castle in Santa Fe. Said to be the largest house in the state, the latter sits atop a hill on a 45,000-acre ranch. He had it built because of the month or so he found himself spending there, talking elementary particle physics with his friend Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel Prize–winning physicist and co-chair of the science board at the Santa Fe Institute.

Epstein also owned a grand house (he has since sold it) near Wexner’s opulent manse at the center of the Limited magnate’s high-end housing development in New Albany, Ohio. New Albany was a lush sprawl of farmland on the outskirts of Columbus that Wexner, starting in 1988, turned into a rich village of multimillion-dollar Georgian homes surrounding a Jack Nicklaus–designed golf course. It was a massive development project, financed largely by Wexner himself. Epstein was a general partner in the real-estate holding company, called New Albany Property, despite putting only a few million dollars of capital into the project.

“Before Epstein came along in 1988, the financial preparations and groundwork for the New Albany development were a total mess,” says Bob Fitrakis, a Columbus-based investigative journalist who has written extensively on Wexner and his finances. “Epstein cleaned everything up, as well as serving Wexner in other capacities — such as facilitating visits to Wexner’s home of the crew from Cats and organizing a Tony Randall song-and-dance show put on in Columbus.” Wexner declines to talk about his relationship with Epstein, but it is clearly one that continues to this day. Not that it helped Epstein in any way to land Clinton. Wexner is a staunch Republican donor, and Epstein, aside from a small contribution to the president’s legal-defense fund, has given more to the likes of former senator Al D’Amato.

What attracted Clinton to Epstein was quite simple: He had a plane (he has a couple, in fact — the Boeing 727, in which he took Clinton to Africa, and, for shorter jaunts, a black Gulfstream, a Cessna 421, and a helicopter to ferry him from his island to St. Thomas). Clinton had organized a weeklong tour of South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Rwanda, and Mozambique to do what Clinton does. So when the president’s advance man Doug Band pitched the idea to Epstein, he said sure. As an added bonus, Kevin Spacey, a close friend of Clinton’s, and actor Chris Tucker came along for the ride.

While Epstein got an intellectual kick out of engaging African finance ministers in theoretical chitchat about economic development, the real payoff for him was observing Clinton in his métier: talking HIV/aids policy with African leaders and soaking up the love from Cape Town to Lagos.

Epstein brings a trophy-hunter’s zeal to his collection of scientists and politicians. But the real charge for him is in seeing these guys work it. Like former Democratic Senate leader George Mitchell, for example. In Epstein’s mind, Mitchell is the world’s greatest negotiator, based on his work in Ireland and the Middle East. So he wrote the senator a bunch of checks. Says Mitchell: “He has supported some philanthropic projects of mine and organized a fund-raiser for me once. I would certainly call him a friend and a supporter.”

But it is his covey of scientists that inspires Epstein’s true rapture. Epstein spends $20 million a year on them — encouraging them to engage in whatever kind of cutting-edge research might attract their fancy. They are, of course, quite lavish in their praise in return. Gerald Edelman won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1972 and now presides over the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla. “Jeff is extraordinary in his ability to pick up on quantitative relations,” says Edelman. “He came to see us recently. He is concerned with this basic question: Is it true that the brain is not a computer? He is very quick.”

Then there is Stephen Kosslyn, a psychologist at Harvard. Epstein flew up to Kosslyn’s laboratory in Cambridge this year to witness an experiment that Kosslyn was conducting and Epstein was funding. Namely: Is it true that certain Tibetan monks are capable of holding a distinct mental image in their minds for twenty minutes straight? “We disproved the thesis,” says Kosslyn. “Jeff was on his cell phone most of the time — he actually wanted to short the Tibetan market, because he thought the monk was so stupid. He is amazing. Like a honeybee — he talks to all these different people and cross-pollinates. Just two months ago, I was talking to him about a new alternative to evolutionary psychology. He got excited and sent me a check.”

Epstein has a particularly close relationship with Martin Nowak, an Austrian biology and mathematics professor who heads the theoretical-biology program at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Nowak is examining how game theory can be used to answer some of the basic evolutionary questions — e.g., why, in our Darwinian society, does altruistic behavior exist? Epstein talks to Nowak about once a week and flies him around the country to his various homes to deliver impromptu lectures. Over the past three years, he has written $500,000 worth of checks to fund Nowak’s research. This past February, Epstein had Nowak over for dinner at the 71st Street townhouse. It was just the two of them (not including the wait staff), and Nowak, making use of a blackboard in the formal dining room, delivered a two-hour highly mathematical description of how language works.

After dinner, Epstein asked if Nowak wanted to meet up with his new friend President Clinton, and off they went to a nearby deli, where Clinton regaled the starstruck former Oxford professor with tales from his own Oxford days. “Jeffrey has the mind of a physicist. It’s like talking to a colleague in your field,” says Nowak. “Sometimes he applies what we talk about to his investments. Sometimes it’s for his own curiosity. He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want.”

Danny Hillis, an MIT-educated computer scientist whose company, Thinking Machines, was at the forefront of the supercomputing world in the eighties, and who used to run R&D at Walt Disney Imagineering, thinks Epstein is actually using scientific knowledge to beat the markets. “We talk about currency trading — the euro, the real, the yen,” he says. “He has something a physicist would call physical intuition. He knows when to use the math and when to throw it away. If I had acted upon all the investment advice he has been giving me over the years, I’d be calling you from my Gulfstream right now.”

On the 727 these days, he has been reading a book by E. O. Wilson, the eminent scientist and originator of the field of sociobiology, called Consilience, which makes the case that the boundaries between scientific disciplines are in the process of breaking down. It’s a view Epstein himself holds. He wrote recently to a scientist friend of his: “The behavior of termites, together with ants and bees, is a precursor to trust because they have an extraordinary ability to form relationships and sophisticated social structures based on mutual altruism even though individually they are fundamentally dumb. Money itself is a derivative of trust. If we can figure out how termites come together, then we may be able to better understand the underlying principles of market behavior — and make big money.”

So how do termite grouping patterns fare as an investment strategy? Again, facts are hard to come by. A working day for Epstein starts at 5 a.m., when he gets up and scours the world markets on his Bloomberg screen — each of his houses, in New York, St. Thomas, Palm Beach, and New Mexico, as well as the 727, is equipped with the necessary hardware for him to wake up, roll out of bed, and start trading. He will put some calls in to his private banker at JPMorgan to get a reading as to how wealthy investors — the best gauge of market sentiment, he believes — are reacting to the market’s movements. Then he will call currency traders in Europe. On a given day, he will spend ten hours or so on the phone — after all, he is running $15 billion essentially by himself.

Strangely enough, given his scientific obsessions, he is a computer-phobe and does not use e-mail. “I like to hear voices and see faces when I interact,” he has said. Given the huge sums he has to invest, he focuses on assets with extremely high liquidity, like currencies — though he dabbles in commodities and real estate as well. Those who know him say he is an impulsive, quick-to-change-his-mind trader, still governed by Ace Greenberg’s trader’s maxim: If the stock is down 10 percent, sell it. He has been on the short side of the Brazilian real, and those close to him say bets there have paid off in spades. He recently took a long position on the euro before its rebound on the basis that Europeans were too proud to see their currency sink any lower against the dollar. His next targets: an across-the-board short of the German stock exchange and a possible attack on the Hong Kong dollar peg in light of the recent disclosure of North Korea’s nuclear-weapons program.

None of this is investment rocket science, but getting the direction and the timing right, no matter how conventional the investment idea, can spin large money for an investor. Before taking a big position, Epstein will usually fly to the country in question. He recently spent a week in Germany meeting with various government officials and financial types, and he has a trip to Brazil coming up in the next few weeks. On all of these trips, he flies alone in his commercial-jet-size 727. 

Friends of Epstein say he is horrified at the recent swell of media attention around him (Vanity Fair is preparing a megaprofile, and the Villard House office has had a barrage of calls from other media outlets). He has never granted a formal interview, and did not offer one to this magazine, nor has his picture appeared in any publication. Yet for one so obsessive about his privacy, one wonders — didn’t he realize that flying Clinton and Spacey around Africa was going to blow his cover? As he said to a friend: “If my ultimate goal was to stay private, traveling with Clinton was a bad move on the chessboard. I recognize that now. But you know what? Even Kasparov makes them. You move on.”"

The fourth day of testimony in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell began with an expert witness describing how sexual abusers prepare, or “groom,” their prospective victims and concluded with an insider’s view of life at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach home.

That perspective was provided by Juan Alessi, 71, who said he had been a property manager at the Palm Beach home from about 1990 until 2002.

On the stand, Mr. Alessi read from a 58-page document titled “Household Manual” that listed ground rules for employees. Among other things, the manual told workers to “try to anticipate the needs of Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and their guests,” forbade them from discussing their personal problems with guests and instructed them: “Remember, that you see nothing, hear nothing say nothing except to answer a question direct to you. Respect their privacy.”

Mr. Alessi testified that he believed that section of the manual constituted “a kind a warning.”

“I was supposed to be blind and dumb,” he said. “To say nothing of their lives.”

Here are some takeaways from the trial.

A prosecution witness described how abusers “groom” child targets.
Dr. Lisa Rocchio, a clinical psychologist, testified that adults who sexually abuse children commonly engage in a process that can be thought of as having five basic steps: (1) selecting a victim, (2) obtaining access to and isolating the victim, (3) using “lies and deception and manipulation” to build “trust and attachment,” (4) desensitizing a victim to physical and sexual touching, and (5) maintaining control to coerce the victim into accepting continued abuse.

Dr. Rocchio said that “grooming” process could include giving gifts, building rapport through expressions of concern, bringing up sexual subjects in conversation and slowly escalating sexualized physical interactions with prospective victims.

The testimony offered jurors a way to link Maxwell to Epstein’s abuses.
Dr. Rocchio’s testimony was meant to bolster the government’s case by establishing that Ms. Maxwell played a key role in making girls vulnerable to Mr. Epstein.

The testimony dovetailed with the prosecution’s description of Ms. Maxwell in its opening statement: “The defendant took these girls on shopping trips, asked them about their lives, their schools, their families. She won their trust. She discussed sexual topics with them. She helped normalize abusive sexual conduct. She put them at ease and made them feel safe all so that they could be molested by a middle-aged man.”

A former employee at Epstein’s Palm Beach home detailed Maxwell’s pervasive control.
Mr. Alessi, who worked at the Palm Beach property for some 12 years, testified about the strict rules that Ms. Maxwell put in place there, from the placement of phone directories (always to the right of the telephones) to sharp limits on employees’ behavior.

Employees were never to look Mr. Epstein in the eye, even while answering a question from him, Mr. Alessi said. They were, however, to keep watch for any holes in the property fence that Ms. Maxwell’s Yorkie, Max, might escape through. (Max went everywhere with Ms. Maxwell, even on Mr. Epstein’s private jet. “The poor dog shake like crazy,” Mr. Alessi, who is from Ecuador, testified. “Because she didn’t like to be in the plane.”)

The employee recalled many young, topless women at the estate.
It was common for young women to visit Mr. Epstein in Palm Beach, Mr. Alessi said. “Many, many many females” showed up at the home, he testified, adding that most of them appeared to be in their 20s.

Women arrived to lounge by Mr. Epstein’s pool on hundreds of occasions, Mr. Alessi said. They were topless almost 80 percent of the time, he estimated.

Among those that visited the house were two girls who Mr. Alessi said appeared to be underage. One of them, now an adult, appeared on the stand earlier this week, identified only as “Jane.” She testified that Mr. Epstein had sexually abused her for years, starting when she was 14.

Mr. Alessi remembered Jane vividly. She was, he said on the stand, a “strikingly beautiful girl, beautiful eyes, long hair, long brunette hair, tall, very pleasant.”"
